## 570. Managers with at Least 5 Direct Reports - *Medium*

**Table Employee:**

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| department  | varchar |
| managerId   | int     |

`id` is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name of an employee, their department, and the ID of their manager.
If `managerId` is `null`, then the employee does not have a manager.
No employee will be the manager of themselves.

Write a solution to find managers with at least five direct reports.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

Input: 

Employee table:

| id  | name  | department | managerId |
|-----|-------|------------|-----------|
| 101 | John  | A          | None      |
| 102 | Dan   | A          | 101       |
| 103 | James | A          | 101       |
| 104 | Amy   | A          | 101       |
| 105 | Anne  | A          | 101       |
| 106 | Ron   | B          | 101       |

Output: 

| name |
|------|
| John |

Explanation: 
- John is the only manager with at least five direct reports (Dan, James, Amy, Anne, and Ron).

## **Solution:**

```python
import pandas as pd

def find_managers(employee: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:

    new_df = employee.groupby('managerId', as_index = False)

    new_df_agg = new_df.agg(reporting = ('id', 'count'))

    new_df_condition = new_df_agg.query('reporting >= 5')['managerId']

    ans = employee[employee['id'].isin(new_df_condition)][['name']]

    return ans
```

## Explanation:

Let's break down the provided code step by step:

```python
import pandas as pd
```
This line imports the Pandas library and assigns it the alias `pd`.

```python
def find_managers(employee: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
```
This code defines a function named `find_managers` that takes a Pandas DataFrame `employee` as a parameter. The type annotation `: pd.DataFrame` indicates that the `employee` parameter is expected to be a DataFrame. The function is annotated to return a Pandas DataFrame.

```python
    new_df = employee.groupby('managerId', as_index=False)
```
In this line, the `groupby()` method is applied to the `employee` DataFrame. The DataFrame is grouped by the 'managerId' column. The `as_index=False` parameter ensures that the group labels (manager IDs) are not set as the index of the resulting DataFrame.

```python
    new_df_agg = new_df.agg(reporting=('id', 'count'))
```
Here, the `agg()` method is applied to the grouped DataFrame `new_df`. The aggregation is performed using the following aggregation function:

- `reporting=('id', 'count')`: This calculates the count of occurrences of 'id' within each group. The result is assigned to a column named 'reporting'.

The resulting `new_df_agg` DataFrame contains columns 'managerId' and 'reporting', where 'reporting' represents the count of employees reporting to each manager.

```python
    new_df_condition = new_df_agg.query('reporting >= 5')['managerId']
```
In this line, a new DataFrame `new_df_condition` is created by querying the `new_df_agg` DataFrame. The query condition `'reporting >= 5'` is used to select rows where the count of reporting employees ('reporting' column) is greater than or equal to 5. The result is a Series containing the manager IDs that meet this condition.

```python
    ans = employee[employee['id'].isin(new_df_condition)][['name']]
```
Here, a new DataFrame `ans` is created by filtering the `employee` DataFrame. The condition `employee['id'].isin(new_df_condition)` is used to select rows where the 'id' column values match the manager IDs in the `new_df_condition` Series. The `[['name']]` indexing operation is then used to extract only the 'name' column from the filtered rows.

```python
    return ans
```
Finally, the DataFrame `ans` containing the names of employees who have managers with at least 5 reporting employees is returned as the output of the `find_managers` function.

To summarize, the `find_managers` function takes a DataFrame of employee information, groups the data by manager IDs, calculates the count of reporting employees for each manager, filters out managers with less than 5 reporting employees, and returns a DataFrame with the names of employees who report to these managers.
