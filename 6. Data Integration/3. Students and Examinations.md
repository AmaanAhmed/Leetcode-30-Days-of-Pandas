## 1280. Students and Examinations - *Easy*

**Table Students:**

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| student_id  | int     |
| student_name| varchar |

* `student_id` is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
* Each row of this table contains the ID and the name of one student in the school.

**Table Subjects:**

| Column Name  | Type    |
|--------------|---------|
| subject_name | varchar |

* `subject_name` is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
* Each row of this table contains the name of one subject in the school.

**Table Examinations:**

| Column Name  | Type    |
|--------------|---------|
| student_id   | int     |
| subject_name | varchar |

* There is no primary key (column with unique values) for this table. It may contain duplicates.
* Each student from the Students table takes every course from the Subjects table.
* Each row of this table indicates that a student with ID `student_id` attended the exam of `subject_name`.

Write a solution to find the number of times each student attended each exam.

Return the result table ordered by `student_id` and `subject_name`.

The result format is in the following example.

| 13         | John         | Programming  | 1              |

Explanation: 
- The result table should contain all students and all subjects.
- Alice attended the Math exam 3 times, the Physics exam 2 times, and the Programming exam 1 time.
- Bob attended the Math exam 1 time, the Programming exam 1 time, and did not attend the Physics exam.
- Alex did not attend any exams.
- John attended the Math exam 1 time, the Physics exam 1 time, and the Programming exam 1 time.

## **Solution:**

```python
import pandas as pd

def students_and_examinations(students: pd.DataFrame, subjects: pd.DataFrame, examinations: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:

    exam_df = examinations.groupby(['student_id', 'subject_name'])
    exam_df = exam_df.agg(attended_exams = ('subject_name', 'count')).reset_index()

    new_df = pd.merge(students, subjects, how = 'cross')
    new_df = new_df.sort_values(by = ['student_id','subject_name'])

    ans = pd.merge(new_df, exam_df, how = 'left', on = ['student_id', 'subject_name'])
    ans = ans.fillna(0)

    return ans[['student_id', 'student_name', 'subject_name', 'attended_exams']]
```

## Explanation:

Let's go through the provided code step by step:

```python
import pandas as pd
```
This line imports the Pandas library and assigns it the alias `pd`.

```python
def students_and_examinations(students: pd.DataFrame, subjects: pd.DataFrame, examinations: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
```
This code defines a function named `students_and_examinations` that takes three Pandas DataFrames, `students`, `subjects`, and `examinations`, as parameters. The type annotations `: pd.DataFrame` indicate that these parameters are expected to be DataFrames. The function is annotated to return a Pandas DataFrame.

```python
    exam_df = examinations.groupby(['student_id', 'subject_name'])
    exam_df = exam_df.agg(attended_exams=('subject_name', 'count')).reset_index()
```
In this section, the `examinations` DataFrame is grouped by both 'student_id' and 'subject_name' columns using the `groupby()` method. Then, the `agg()` method is used to aggregate the grouped data with the following aggregation:

- `attended_exams=('subject_name', 'count')`: This calculates the count of occurrences of 'subject_name' within each combination of 'student_id' and 'subject_name' group. The result is assigned to a column named 'attended_exams'.

The `reset_index()` method is then used to reset the index of the resulting DataFrame and convert the group labels (student IDs and subject names) back into columns. The resulting DataFrame `exam_df` contains columns 'student_id', 'subject_name', and 'attended_exams'.

```python
    new_df = pd.merge(students, subjects, how='cross')
    new_df = new_df.sort_values(by=['student_id', 'subject_name'])
```
In this section, a new DataFrame `new_df` is created by performing a cross join between the `students` and `subjects` DataFrames using the `pd.merge()` function with `how='cross'`. This effectively combines every row from `students` with every row from `subjects`.

The resulting `new_df` is then sorted based on the 'student_id' and 'subject_name' columns using the `sort_values()` method.

```python
    ans = pd.merge(new_df, exam_df, how='left', on=['student_id', 'subject_name'])
    ans = ans.fillna(0)
```
In this section, the `new_df` DataFrame is merged with the `exam_df` DataFrame based on the 'student_id' and 'subject_name' columns using a left join operation. This combines the information from both DataFrames.

The resulting `ans` DataFrame is then filled with zeros using the `fillna(0)` method to replace any missing values (NaN) with zeros.

```python
    return ans[['student_id', 'student_name', 'subject_name', 'attended_exams']]
```
Finally, the DataFrame `ans` containing the 'student_id', 'student_name', 'subject_name', and 'attended_exams' columns is returned as the output of the `students_and_examinations` function.

To summarize, the `students_and_examinations` function takes DataFrames of student information, subject information, and examination records, performs a cross join between students and subjects, aggregates examination data, merges the results, and returns a DataFrame with student IDs, student names, subject names, and the count of attended exams.
