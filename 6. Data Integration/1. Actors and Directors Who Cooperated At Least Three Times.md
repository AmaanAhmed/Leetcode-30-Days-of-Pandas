## 1050. Actors and Directors Who Cooperated At Least Three Times - *Easy*

**Table ActorDirector:**

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| actor_id    | int     |
| director_id | int     |
| timestamp   | int     |

`timestamp` is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.

Write a solution to find all the pairs `(actor_id, director_id)` where the actor has cooperated with the director at least three times.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

Input: 

ActorDirector table:

| actor_id | director_id | timestamp |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| 1        | 1           | 0         |
| 1        | 1           | 1         |
| 1        | 1           | 2         |
| 1        | 2           | 3         |
| 1        | 2           | 4         |
| 2        | 1           | 5         |
| 2        | 1           | 6         |

Output: 

| actor_id | director_id |
|----------|-------------|
| 1        | 1           |

Explanation: The only pair is `(1, 1)` where they cooperated exactly 3 times.

## **Solution:**

```python
import pandas as pd

def actors_and_directors(actor_director: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:

    ans = actor_director.groupby(['actor_id','director_id']).agg(count = ('director_id', 'count')).reset_index()

    ans = ans[ans['count'] >= 3]

    ans = ans[['actor_id','director_id']]

    return ans
```

## Explanation:

Let's break down the provided code step by step:

```python
import pandas as pd
```
This line imports the Pandas library and assigns it the alias `pd`.

```python
def actors_and_directors(actor_director: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
```
This code defines a function named `actors_and_directors` that takes a Pandas DataFrame `actor_director` as a parameter. The type annotation `: pd.DataFrame` indicates that the `actor_director` parameter is expected to be a DataFrame. The function is annotated to return a Pandas DataFrame.

```python
    ans = actor_director.groupby(['actor_id', 'director_id']).agg(count=('director_id', 'count')).reset_index()
```
In this line, the `groupby()` method is applied to the `actor_director` DataFrame. The DataFrame is grouped by the columns 'actor_id' and 'director_id'. The `agg()` method is then used to aggregate the grouped data using the following aggregation:

- `count=('director_id', 'count')`: This calculates the count of occurrences of 'director_id' within each actor-director combination group. The result is assigned to a column named 'count'.

The `reset_index()` method is then used to reset the index of the resulting DataFrame and convert the group labels (actor IDs and director IDs) back into columns. The resulting DataFrame `ans` contains columns 'actor_id', 'director_id', and 'count'.

```python
    ans = ans[ans['count'] >= 3]
```
Here, a new DataFrame `ans` is created by filtering the `ans` DataFrame. The condition `ans['count'] >= 3` is used to select rows where the count of occurrences ('count' column) is greater than or equal to 3. This filters out actor-director combinations that appear in at least three occurrences.

```python
    ans = ans[['actor_id', 'director_id']]
```
In this line, the `ans` DataFrame is further filtered to keep only the 'actor_id' and 'director_id' columns, effectively removing the 'count' column.

```python
    return ans
```
Finally, the DataFrame `ans` containing the actor-director combinations that appear in at least three occurrences is returned as the output of the `actors_and_directors` function.

To summarize, the `actors_and_directors` function takes a DataFrame of actor-director relationships, groups the data by actor and director combinations, calculates the count of occurrences for each combination, filters out combinations that appear in at least three occurrences, and returns a DataFrame with the filtered actor-director combinations.
