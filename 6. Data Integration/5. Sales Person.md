* `sales_id` is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
* Each row of this table indicates the name and the ID of a salesperson alongside their salary, commission rate, and hire date.

**Table Company:**

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| com_id      | int     |

* Each row of this table indicates the name and the ID of a company and the city in which the company is located.

**Table Orders:**

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| order_id    | int  |
| order_date  | date |
| com_id      | int  |
| sales_id    | int  |

* `order_id` is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
* `com_id` is a foreign key (reference column) to `com_id` from the Company table.
* `sales_id` is a foreign key (reference column) to `sales_id` from the SalesPerson table.
* Each row of this table contains information about one order. This includes the ID of the company, the ID of the salesperson, the date of the order, and the amount paid.

Write a solution to find the names of all the salespersons who did not have any orders related to the company with the name "RED".

Return the result table in any order.

Explanation: 
- According to orders 3 and 4 in the Orders table, it is easy to tell that only salesperson John and Pam have sales to company RED, so we report all the other names in the table salesperson.

## **Solution:**

```python
import pandas as pd

def sales_person(sales_person: pd.DataFrame, company: pd.DataFrame, orders: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:

    new_df = pd.merge(orders, company, how = 'inner', on = 'com_id')

    new_df_unique = new_df[new_df['name'] == 'RED']['sales_id'].unique()

    ans = sales_person[~sales_person['sales_id'].isin(new_df_unique)][['name']]

    return ans
```

## Explanation:

Let's break down the provided code step by step:

```python
import pandas as pd
```
This line imports the Pandas library and assigns it the alias `pd`.

```python
def sales_person(sales_person: pd.DataFrame, company: pd.DataFrame, orders: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
```
This code defines a function named `sales_person` that takes three Pandas DataFrames, `sales_person`, `company`, and `orders`, as parameters. The type annotations `: pd.DataFrame` indicate that these parameters are expected to be DataFrames. The function is annotated to return a Pandas DataFrame.

```python
    new_df = pd.merge(orders, company, how='inner', on='com_id')
```
In this line, the `pd.merge()` function is used to combine the `orders` and `company` DataFrames based on the 'com_id' column using an inner join operation. This combines the information from both DataFrames where the 'com_id' values match.

The resulting `new_df` DataFrame contains columns from both DataFrames for the matching rows.

```python
    new_df_unique = new_df[new_df['name'] == 'RED']['sales_id'].unique()
```
In this line, a new DataFrame `new_df_unique` is created by filtering the `new_df` DataFrame. The condition `new_df['name'] == 'RED'` is used to select rows where the 'name' column has the value 'RED'. The `['sales_id']` indexing operation is then used to extract the 'sales_id' column from the filtered rows. The `.unique()` method is applied to get the unique values of 'sales_id' within the filtered rows.

```python
    ans = sales_person[~sales_person['sales_id'].isin(new_df_unique)][['name']]
```
Here, a new DataFrame `ans` is created by filtering the `sales_person` DataFrame. The condition `~sales_person['sales_id'].isin(new_df_unique)` is used to select rows where the 'sales_id' column values are not in the `new_df_unique` array. The `[['name']]` indexing operation is then used to extract only the 'name' column from the filtered rows.

```python
    return ans
```
Finally, the DataFrame `ans` containing the names of salespersons who did not have any orders from companies with the name 'RED' is returned as the output of the `sales_person` function.

To summarize, the `sales_person` function takes DataFrames of salesperson information, company information, and order information, merges them based on the 'com_id' column, filters out salespersons who had orders from companies with the name 'RED', and returns a DataFrame with the names of salespersons who did not have such orders.
