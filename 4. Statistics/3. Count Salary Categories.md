## 1907. Count Salary Categories - *Medium*

**Table: Accounts**

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| account_id  | int  |
| income      | int  |

* account_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
* Each row contains information about the monthly income for one bank account.

Write a solution to calculate the number of bank accounts for each salary category. The salary categories are:

1. "Low Salary": All the salaries strictly less than $20000.
2. "Average Salary": All the salaries in the inclusive range [$20000, $50000].
3. "High Salary": All the salaries strictly greater than $50000.

The result table must contain all three categories. If there are no accounts in a category, return 0.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

Input: 

Accounts table:

| account_id | income |
|------------|--------|
| 3          | 108939 |
| 2          | 12747  |
| 8          | 87709  |
| 6          | 91796  |

Output: 

| category       | accounts_count |
|----------------|----------------|
| Low Salary     | 1              |
| Average Salary | 0              |
| High Salary    | 3              |

Explanation: 
* Low Salary: Account 2.
* Average Salary: No accounts.
* High Salary: Accounts 3, 6, and 8.

## **Solution:**

```python
import pandas as pd

def count_salary_categories(accounts: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:

    low_salary = accounts[accounts['income'] < 20000]

    low_salary_sum = low_salary.shape[0]

    average_salary = accounts[(accounts['income'] >= 20000) & (accounts['income'] <= 50000)]

    average_salary_sum = average_salary.shape[0]

    high_salary = accounts[accounts['income'] > 50000]

    high_salary_sum = high_salary.shape[0]

    result_df = pd.DataFrame({
        'category' : ['High Salary', 'Low Salary', 'Average Salary'],
        'accounts_count' : [high_salary_sum, low_salary_sum, average_salary_sum]
    })

    return result_df
```

## Explanation:

Let's break down the provided code step by step:

```python
import pandas as pd
```
This line imports the Pandas library and assigns it the alias `pd`.

```python
def count_salary_categories(accounts: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
```
This code defines a function named `count_salary_categories` that takes a Pandas DataFrame `accounts` as a parameter. The type annotation `: pd.DataFrame` indicates that the `accounts` parameter is expected to be a DataFrame. The function is annotated to return a Pandas DataFrame.

```python
    low_salary = accounts[accounts['income'] < 20000]
```
In this line, a new DataFrame `low_salary` is created by filtering the `accounts` DataFrame. The condition `accounts['income'] < 20000` is used to select rows where the 'income' column value is less than 20000.

```python
    low_salary_sum = low_salary.shape[0]
```
The variable `low_salary_sum` is assigned the number of rows in the `low_salary` DataFrame, effectively counting the number of accounts with incomes less than 20000.

```python
    average_salary = accounts[(accounts['income'] >= 20000) & (accounts['income'] <= 50000)]
```
Here, a new DataFrame `average_salary` is created by filtering the `accounts` DataFrame. The condition `(accounts['income'] >= 20000) & (accounts['income'] <= 50000)` is used to select rows where the 'income' column value is between 20000 and 50000.

```python
    average_salary_sum = average_salary.shape[0]
```
The variable `average_salary_sum` is assigned the number of rows in the `average_salary` DataFrame, effectively counting the number of accounts with incomes between 20000 and 50000.

```python
    high_salary = accounts[accounts['income'] > 50000]
```
Another new DataFrame `high_salary` is created by filtering the `accounts` DataFrame. The condition `accounts['income'] > 50000` is used to select rows where the 'income' column value is greater than 50000.

```python
    high_salary_sum = high_salary.shape[0]
```
The variable `high_salary_sum` is assigned the number of rows in the `high_salary` DataFrame, effectively counting the number of accounts with incomes greater than 50000.

```python
    result_df = pd.DataFrame({
        'category': ['High Salary', 'Low Salary', 'Average Salary'],
        'accounts_count': [high_salary_sum, low_salary_sum, average_salary_sum]
    })
```
A new DataFrame `result_df` is created using the `pd.DataFrame()` constructor. It contains two columns: 'category' and 'accounts_count'. The 'category' column contains the categories of salary levels, and the 'accounts_count' column contains the corresponding counts.

```python
    return result_df
```
Finally, the DataFrame `result_df` containing the counts of accounts in different salary categories is returned as the output of the `count_salary_categories` function.

To summarize, the `count_salary_categories` function takes a DataFrame of account information, categorizes accounts based on their income levels, counts the number of accounts in each category, and returns a DataFrame with the categories and corresponding counts.
