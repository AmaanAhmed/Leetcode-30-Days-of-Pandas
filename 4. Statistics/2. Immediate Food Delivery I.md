## 1173. Immediate Food Delivery I - *Easy*

**Table: Delivery**

| Column Name                 | Type    |
|-----------------------------|---------|
| delivery_id                 | int     |
| customer_id                 | int     |
| order_date                  | date    |
| customer_pref_delivery_date | date    |

* delivery_id is the primary key (column with unique values) of this table.
* The table holds information about food delivery to customers that make orders at some date and specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or after it).

If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then the order is called immediate; otherwise, it is called scheduled.

Write a solution to find the percentage of immediate orders in the table, rounded to 2 decimal places.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

Input: 

Delivery table:

| delivery_id | customer_id | order_date | customer_pref_delivery_date |
|-------------|-------------|------------|-----------------------------|
| 1           | 1           | 2019-08-01 | 2019-08-02                  |
| 2           | 5           | 2019-08-02 | 2019-08-02                  |
| 3           | 1           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-11                  |
| 4           | 3           | 2019-08-24 | 2019-08-26                  |
| 5           | 4           | 2019-08-21 | 2019-08-22                  |
| 6           | 2           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-13                  |

Output: 

| immediate_percentage |
|----------------------|
| 33.33                |

Explanation: The orders with delivery id 2 and 3 are immediate while the others are scheduled.

## **Solution:**

```python
import pandas as pd

def food_delivery(delivery: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:

    same_date = delivery[delivery['order_date'] == delivery['customer_pref_delivery_date']]

    count_same_date = same_date.shape[0]

    total_orders = delivery.shape[0]

    percentage = (count_same_date / total_orders) * 100

    ans = pd.DataFrame({'immediate_percentage': [round(percentage, 2)]})

    return ans
```

## Explanation:

Let's go through the provided code step by step:

```python
import pandas as pd
```
This line imports the Pandas library and assigns it the alias `pd`.

```python
def food_delivery(delivery: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
```
This code defines a function named `food_delivery` that takes a Pandas DataFrame `delivery` as a parameter. The type annotation `: pd.DataFrame` indicates that the `delivery` parameter is expected to be a DataFrame. The function is annotated to return a Pandas DataFrame.

```python
    same_date = delivery[delivery['order_date'] == delivery['customer_pref_delivery_date']]
```
In this line, a new DataFrame `same_date` is created by filtering the `delivery` DataFrame. The condition `delivery['order_date'] == delivery['customer_pref_delivery_date']` is used to select rows where the 'order_date' column value matches the 'customer_pref_delivery_date' column value. This will include rows where the order and customer preferred delivery date are the same.

```python
    count_same_date = same_date.shape[0]
```
The variable `count_same_date` is assigned the number of rows in the `same_date` DataFrame, effectively counting the number of orders with matching order and preferred delivery dates.

```python
    total_orders = delivery.shape[0]
```
The variable `total_orders` is assigned the total number of rows in the `delivery` DataFrame, representing the total number of orders.

```python
    percentage = (count_same_date / total_orders) * 100
```
Here, the percentage of orders with matching order and preferred delivery dates is calculated by dividing `count_same_date` by `total_orders` and then multiplying by 100.

```python
    ans = pd.DataFrame({'immediate_percentage': [round(percentage, 2)]})
```
A new DataFrame `ans` is created using the `pd.DataFrame()` constructor. It contains a single row with a single column named 'immediate_percentage', and the value is the calculated `percentage` rounded to 2 decimal places.

```python
    return ans
```
Finally, the DataFrame `ans` containing the calculated percentage of orders with immediate delivery is returned as the output of the `food_delivery` function.

To summarize, the `food_delivery` function takes a DataFrame of delivery information, filters out rows with matching order and preferred delivery dates, calculates the percentage of such immediate deliveries, and returns a DataFrame with the calculated percentage.
