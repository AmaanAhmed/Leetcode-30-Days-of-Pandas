## 2082. The Number of Rich Customers - *Easy*

**Table: Store**

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| bill_id     | int  |
| customer_id | int  |
| amount      | int  |

* bill_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
* Each row contains information about the amount of one bill and the customer associated with it.

Write a solution to report the number of customers who had at least one bill with an amount strictly greater than 500.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

Input: 

Store table:

| bill_id | customer_id | amount |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| 6       | 1           | 549    |
| 8       | 1           | 834    |
| 4       | 2           | 394    |
| 11      | 3           | 657    |
| 13      | 3           | 257    |

Output: 

| rich_count |
|------------|
| 2          |

Explanation: 
* Customer 1 has two bills with amounts strictly greater than 500.
* Customer 2 does not have any bills with an amount strictly greater than 500.
* Customer 3 has one bill with an amount strictly greater than 500.

## **Solution:**

```python
import pandas as pd

def count_rich_customers(store: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    new_df = store[store.amount > 500]
    unique_df = new_df['customer_id'].nunique()
    ans = pd.DataFrame({'rich_count': [unique_df]})
    return ans
```

## Explanation:

Let's break down the provided code step by step:

```python
import pandas as pd
```
This line imports the Pandas library and assigns it the alias `pd`.

```python
def count_rich_customers(store: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
```
This code defines a function named `count_rich_customers` that takes a Pandas DataFrame `store` as a parameter. The type annotation `: pd.DataFrame` indicates that the `store` parameter is expected to be a DataFrame. The function is annotated to return a Pandas DataFrame.

```python
    new_df = store[store.amount > 500]
```
In this line, a new DataFrame `new_df` is created by filtering the `store` DataFrame. The condition `store.amount > 500` is used to select rows where the 'amount' column value is greater than 500.

```python
    unique_df = new_df['customer_id'].nunique()
```
Here, the `.nunique()` method is applied to the 'customer_id' column of the filtered `new_df` DataFrame. This method counts the number of unique values in the 'customer_id' column, representing the count of distinct customers who made purchases with amounts greater than 500.

```python
    ans = pd.DataFrame({'rich_count': [unique_df]})
```
A new DataFrame `ans` is created using the `pd.DataFrame()` constructor. It contains a single row with a single column named 'rich_count', and the value is the calculated `unique_df` from the previous step.

```python
    return ans
```
Finally, the DataFrame `ans` containing the count of unique rich customers is returned as the output of the `count_rich_customers` function.

To summarize, the `count_rich_customers` function takes a DataFrame of store transactions, filters out transactions with amounts greater than 500, counts the number of unique customers with such transactions, and returns a DataFrame with the count of unique rich customers. The overall structure of this function is very similar to the previously explained version.
