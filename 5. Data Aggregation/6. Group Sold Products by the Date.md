## 1484. Group Sold Products By The Date - *Easy*

**Table Activities:**

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| sell_date   | date    |
| product     | varchar |

* There is no primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
* It may contain duplicates.
* Each row of this table contains the product name and the date it was sold in a market.

Write a solution to find for each date the number of different products sold and their names.

The sold products names for each date should be sorted lexicographically.

Return the result table ordered by sell_date.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

Input: 

Activities table:

| sell_date  | product     |
|------------|------------|
| 2020-05-30 | Headphone  |
| 2020-06-01 | Pencil     |
| 2020-06-02 | Mask       |
| 2020-05-30 | Basketball |
| 2020-06-01 | Bible      |
| 2020-06-02 | Mask       |
| 2020-05-30 | T-Shirt    |

Output: 

| sell_date  | num_sold | products                     |
|------------|----------|------------------------------|
| 2020-05-30 | 3        | Basketball,Headphone,T-shirt |
| 2020-06-01 | 2        | Bible,Pencil                 |
| 2020-06-02 | 1        | Mask                         |

Explanation: 
* For 2020-05-30, Sold items were (Headphone, Basketball, T-shirt), we sort them lexicographically and separate them by a comma.
* For 2020-06-01, Sold items were (Pencil, Bible), we sort them lexicographically and separate them by a comma.
* For 2020-06-02, the Sold item is (Mask), we just return it.

## **Solution:**

```python
import pandas as pd

def categorize_products(activities: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:

    ans = activities.groupby('sell_date')['product'].agg([
        ('num_sold', 'nunique'),
        ('products', lambda x: ','.join(sorted(x.unique())))
    ]).reset_index()

    return ans
```

## Explanation:

Let's go through the provided code step by step:

```python
import pandas as pd
```
This line imports the Pandas library and assigns it the alias `pd`.

```python
def categorize_products(activities: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
```
This code defines a function named `categorize_products` that takes a Pandas DataFrame `activities` as a parameter. The type annotation `: pd.DataFrame` indicates that the `activities` parameter is expected to be a DataFrame. The function is annotated to return a Pandas DataFrame.

```python
    ans = activities.groupby('sell_date')['product'].agg([
        ('num_sold', 'nunique'),
        ('products', lambda x: ','.join(sorted(x.unique())))
    ]).reset_index()
```
In this line, the `groupby()` method is applied to the `activities` DataFrame. The DataFrame is grouped by the 'sell_date' column. The `agg()` method is then used to aggregate the grouped data with two different aggregation functions:

1. `('num_sold', 'nunique')`: This calculates the number of unique products sold on each 'sell_date' and assigns the result to a column named 'num_sold'.

2. `('products', lambda x: ','.join(sorted(x.unique())))`: This aggregates the unique product names for each 'sell_date' by applying a custom lambda function. The lambda function sorts the unique product names, joins them with commas, and assigns the result to a column named 'products'.

The result of the aggregation is stored in a DataFrame named `ans`.

```python
    return ans
```
Finally, the DataFrame `ans` containing the aggregated information about the number of unique products sold and the sorted list of product names for each sell date is returned as the output of the `categorize_products` function.

To summarize, the `categorize_products` function takes a DataFrame of sales activities, groups the data by sell dates, calculates the number of unique products sold and generates a sorted list of product names for each sell date, and returns a DataFrame with the aggregated information.
