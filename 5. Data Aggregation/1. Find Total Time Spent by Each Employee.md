## 1741. Find Total Time Spent by Each Employee - *Easy*

**Table: Employees**

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| emp_id      | int  |
| event_day   | date |
| in_time     | int  |
| out_time    | int  |

* (emp_id, event_day, in_time) is the primary key (combinations of columns with unique values) of this table.
* The table shows the employees' entries and exits in an office.
* event_day is the day at which this event happened, in_time is the minute at which the employee entered the office, and out_time is the minute at which they left the office.
* in_time and out_time are between 1 and 1440.
* It is guaranteed that no two events on the same day intersect in time, and in_time < out_time.

Write a solution to calculate the total time in minutes spent by each employee on each day at the office. Note that within one day, an employee can enter and leave more than once. The time spent in the office for a single entry is out_time - in_time.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

Input: 

Employees table:

| emp_id | event_day  | in_time | out_time |
|--------|------------|---------|----------|
| 1      | 2020-11-28 | 4       | 32       |
| 1      | 2020-11-28 | 55      | 200      |
| 1      | 2020-12-03 | 1       | 42       |
| 2      | 2020-11-28 | 3       | 33       |
| 2      | 2020-12-09 | 47      | 74       |

Output: 

| day        | emp_id | total_time |
|------------|--------|------------|
| 2020-11-28 | 1      | 173        |
| 2020-11-28 | 2      | 30         |
| 2020-12-03 | 1      | 41         |
| 2020-12-09 | 2      | 27         |

Explanation: 
* Employee 1 has three events: two on day 2020-11-28 with a total of (32 - 4) + (200 - 55) = 173, and one on day 2020-12-03 with a total of (42 - 1) = 41.
* Employee 2 has two events: one on day 2020-11-28 with a total of (33 - 3) = 30, and one on day 2020-12-09 with a total of (74 - 47) = 27.

## **Solution:**

```python
import pandas as pd

def total_time(employees: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:

    employees["total_time"] = employees["out_time"] - employees["in_time"]

    new_df = employees.groupby(["emp_id", "event_day"])["total_time"].sum().reset_index()

    new_df.rename({"event_day": "day"}, axis = 1, inplace = True)

    return new_df
```

## Explanation:

Let's break down the provided code step by step:

```python
import pandas as pd
```
This line imports the Pandas library and assigns it the alias `pd`.

```python
def total_time(employees: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
```
This code defines a function named `total_time` that takes a Pandas DataFrame `employees` as a parameter. The type annotation `: pd.DataFrame` indicates that the `employees` parameter is expected to be a DataFrame. The function is annotated to return a Pandas DataFrame.

```python
    employees["total_time"] = employees["out_time"] - employees["in_time"]
```
In this line, a new column named 'total_time' is added to the `employees` DataFrame. The column values are calculated by subtracting the 'in_time' values from the 'out_time' values for each row. This effectively calculates the total time worked for each employee on each event day.

```python
    new_df = employees.groupby(["emp_id", "event_day"])["total_time"].sum().reset_index()
```
Here, the `groupby()` method is applied to the `employees` DataFrame. The DataFrame is grouped by the columns 'emp_id' and 'event_day'. The `["total_time"].sum()` part calculates the sum of the 'total_time' values within each group. The `reset_index()` method is then applied to reset the index of the resulting DataFrame, converting the group labels back into columns.

```python
    new_df.rename({"event_day": "day"}, axis=1, inplace=True)
```
In this line, the column name 'event_day' in the `new_df` DataFrame is renamed to 'day' using the `rename()` method. The `axis=1` parameter indicates that the renaming should be done for columns, and `inplace=True` means the renaming is applied directly to the DataFrame.

```python
    return new_df
```
Finally, the modified DataFrame `new_df` is returned as the output of the `total_time` function. This DataFrame contains the columns 'emp_id', 'day', and 'total_time', showing the total time worked by each employee on each day.

To summarize, the `total_time` function takes a DataFrame of employee event records, calculates the total time worked by each employee on each day, and returns a DataFrame with the employee ID, day, and corresponding total time.
