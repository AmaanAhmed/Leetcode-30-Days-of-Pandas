## 2356. Number of Unique Subjects Taught by Each Teacher - *Easy*

**Table: Teacher**

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| teacher_id  | int  |
| subject_id  | int  |
| dept_id     | int  |

* *(subject_id, dept_id)* is the primary key (combinations of columns with unique values) of this table.
* Each row in this table indicates that the teacher with teacher_id teaches the subject subject_id in the department dept_id.

Write a solution to calculate the number of unique subjects each teacher teaches in the university.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is shown in the following example.

**Example 1:**

Input: 

Teacher table:

| teacher_id | subject_id | dept_id |
|------------|------------|---------|
| 1          | 2          | 3       |
| 1          | 2          | 4       |
| 1          | 3          | 3       |
| 2          | 1          | 1       |
| 2          | 2          | 1       |
| 2          | 3          | 1       |
| 2          | 4          | 1       |

Output:  

| teacher_id | cnt |
|------------|-----|
| 1          | 2   |
| 2          | 4   |

Explanation: 
* Teacher 1:
  - They teach subject 2 in departments 3 and 4.
  - They teach subject 3 in department 3.
* Teacher 2:
  - They teach subject 1 in department 1.
  - They teach subject 2 in department 1.
  - They teach subject 3 in department 1.
  - They teach subject 4 in department 1.

## **Solution:**

```python
import pandas as pd

def find_classes(courses: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:

    new_df = courses.groupby(['class']).count().reset_index()

    ans = new_df[new_df['student'] >= 5][['class']]

    return ans
```

## Explanation:

Let's go through the provided code step by step:

```python
import pandas as pd
```
This line imports the Pandas library and assigns it the alias `pd`.

```python
def find_classes(courses: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
```
This code defines a function named `find_classes` that takes a Pandas DataFrame `courses` as a parameter. The type annotation `: pd.DataFrame` indicates that the `courses` parameter is expected to be a DataFrame. The function is annotated to return a Pandas DataFrame.

```python
    new_df = courses.groupby(['class']).count().reset_index()
```
In this line, the `groupby()` method is applied to the `courses` DataFrame. The DataFrame is grouped by the 'class' column. Then, the `count()` method is applied to each group, which counts the number of occurrences of each unique class. The `reset_index()` method is used to reset the index of the resulting DataFrame and convert the group labels (class names) back into columns. This new DataFrame `new_df` contains the class names and their respective counts.

```python
    ans = new_df[new_df['student'] >= 5][['class']]
```
Here, a new DataFrame `ans` is created by filtering the `new_df` DataFrame. The condition `new_df['student'] >= 5` is used to select rows where the count of students ('student' column) in a class is greater than or equal to 5. The result is a DataFrame containing only the class names that meet this condition.

```python
    return ans
```
Finally, the DataFrame `ans` containing the class names with at least 5 students is returned as the output of the `find_classes` function.

To summarize, the `find_classes` function takes a DataFrame of course enrollment information, groups the data by class names, counts the number of students in each class, filters out classes with less than 5 students, and returns a DataFrame with the class names that have at least 5 students.
