## 2356. Number of Unique Subjects Taught by Each Teacher - *Easy*

**Table: Teacher**

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| teacher_id  | int  |
| subject_id  | int  |
| dept_id     | int  |

* *(subject_id, dept_id)* is the primary key (combinations of columns with unique values) of this table.
* Each row in this table indicates that the teacher with teacher_id teaches the subject subject_id in the department dept_id.

Write a solution to calculate the number of unique subjects each teacher teaches in the university.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is shown in the following example.

**Example 1:**

Input: 

Teacher table:

| teacher_id | subject_id | dept_id |
|------------|------------|---------|
| 1          | 2          | 3       |
| 1          | 2          | 4       |
| 1          | 3          | 3       |
| 2          | 1          | 1       |
| 2          | 2          | 1       |
| 2          | 3          | 1       |
| 2          | 4          | 1       |

Output:  

| teacher_id | cnt |
|------------|-----|
| 1          | 2   |
| 2          | 4   |

Explanation: 
* Teacher 1:
  - They teach subject 2 in departments 3 and 4.
  - They teach subject 3 in department 3.
* Teacher 2:
  - They teach subject 1 in department 1.
  - They teach subject 2 in department 1.
  - They teach subject 3 in department 1.
  - They teach subject 4 in department 1.

## **Solution:**

```python
import pandas as pd

def count_unique_subjects(teacher: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:

    ans = teacher.groupby('teacher_id')['subject_id'].nunique().reset_index()

    ans.rename(columns = {'subject_id': 'cnt'}, inplace = True)

    return ans
```

## Explanation:

Let's break down the provided code step by step:

```python
import pandas as pd
```
This line imports the Pandas library and assigns it the alias `pd`.

```python
def count_unique_subjects(teacher: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
```
This code defines a function named `count_unique_subjects` that takes a Pandas DataFrame `teacher` as a parameter. The type annotation `: pd.DataFrame` indicates that the `teacher` parameter is expected to be a DataFrame. The function is annotated to return a Pandas DataFrame.

```python
    ans = teacher.groupby('teacher_id')['subject_id'].nunique().reset_index()
```
In this line, the `groupby()` method is applied to the `teacher` DataFrame. The DataFrame is grouped by the 'teacher_id' column. Then, the `nunique()` method is applied to calculate the number of unique values in the 'subject_id' column within each group. This effectively counts the number of unique subjects that each teacher teaches.

The result of this operation is a new DataFrame with the 'teacher_id' as the index and the count of unique subjects as the values. The `reset_index()` method is then used to reset the index and convert the index labels (teacher IDs) back into columns.

```python
    ans.rename(columns={'subject_id': 'cnt'}, inplace=True)
```
In this line, the column name 'subject_id' in the `ans` DataFrame is renamed to 'cnt' (short for count) using the `rename()` method. The `inplace=True` parameter indicates that the renaming should be applied directly to the DataFrame.

```python
    return ans
```
Finally, the modified DataFrame `ans` containing teacher IDs and the corresponding count of unique subjects they teach is returned as the output of the `count_unique_subjects` function.

To summarize, the `count_unique_subjects` function takes a DataFrame of teacher-subject relationships, groups the data by teacher IDs, counts the number of unique subjects each teacher teaches, and returns a DataFrame with teacher IDs and their respective subject counts.
