## 1693. Daily Leads and Partners - *Easy*

**Table DailySales:**

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| date_id     | date    |
| make_name   | varchar |
| lead_id     | int     |
| partner_id  | int     |

* There is no primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
* It may contain duplicates.
* This table contains the date and the name of the product sold and the IDs of the lead and partner it was sold to.
* The name consists of only lowercase English letters.

Write a solution to find, for each date_id and make_name, the number of distinct lead_id's and distinct partner_id's.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

Input: 

DailySales table:

| date_id   | make_name | lead_id | partner_id |
|-----------|-----------|---------|------------|
| 2020-12-8 | toyota    | 0       | 1          |
| 2020-12-8 | toyota    | 1       | 0          |
| 2020-12-8 | toyota    | 1       | 2          |
| 2020-12-7 | toyota    | 0       | 2          |
| 2020-12-7 | toyota    | 0       | 1          |
| 2020-12-8 | honda     | 1       | 2          |
| 2020-12-8 | honda     | 2       | 1          |
| 2020-12-7 | honda     | 0       | 1          |
| 2020-12-7 | honda     | 1       | 2          |
| 2020-12-7 | honda     | 2       | 1          |

Output: 

| date_id   | make_name | unique_leads | unique_partners |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| 2020-12-8 | toyota    | 2            | 3               |
| 2020-12-7 | toyota    | 1            | 2               |
| 2020-12-8 | honda     | 2            | 2               |
| 2020-12-7 | honda     | 3            | 2               |

Explanation: 
* For 2020-12-8, toyota gets leads = [0, 1] and partners = [0, 1, 2] while honda gets leads = [1, 2] and partners = [1, 2].
* For 2020-12-7, toyota gets leads = [0] and partners = [1, 2] while honda gets leads = [0, 1, 2] and partners = [1, 2].

## **Solution:**

```python
import pandas as pd

def daily_leads_and_partners(daily_sales: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:

    new_df = daily_sales.groupby(['date_id', 'make_name']).nunique().reset_index()

    ans = new_df.rename(columns = {'lead_id':'unique_leads', 'partner_id':'unique_partners'})

    return ans
```

## Explanation:

Let's break down the provided code step by step:

```python
import pandas as pd
```
This line imports the Pandas library and assigns it the alias `pd`.

```python
def daily_leads_and_partners(daily_sales: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
```
This code defines a function named `daily_leads_and_partners` that takes a Pandas DataFrame `daily_sales` as a parameter. The type annotation `: pd.DataFrame` indicates that the `daily_sales` parameter is expected to be a DataFrame. The function is annotated to return a Pandas DataFrame.

```python
    new_df = daily_sales.groupby(['date_id', 'make_name']).nunique().reset_index()
```
In this line, the `groupby()` method is applied to the `daily_sales` DataFrame. The DataFrame is grouped by the 'date_id' and 'make_name' columns. The `nunique()` method is then applied to each group. The `nunique()` method calculates the number of unique values within each group for each column. The result is a new DataFrame `new_df` containing the count of unique values for each combination of 'date_id' and 'make_name', representing the count of unique leads and partners for each date and make.

The `reset_index()` method is used to reset the index of the resulting DataFrame and convert the group labels (date IDs and make names) back into columns.

```python
    ans = new_df.rename(columns={'lead_id': 'unique_leads', 'partner_id': 'unique_partners'})
```
In this line, the column names 'lead_id' and 'partner_id' in the `new_df` DataFrame are renamed to 'unique_leads' and 'unique_partners', respectively, using the `rename()` method. The resulting DataFrame `ans` now has updated column names.

```python
    return ans
```
Finally, the DataFrame `ans` containing the count of unique leads and partners for each date and make is returned as the output of the `daily_leads_and_partners` function.

To summarize, the `daily_leads_and_partners` function takes a DataFrame of daily sales information, groups the data by date and make, calculates the count of unique leads and partners for each group, renames the columns accordingly, and returns a DataFrame with the updated information.
