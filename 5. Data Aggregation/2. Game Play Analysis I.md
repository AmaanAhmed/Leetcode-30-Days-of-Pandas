## 511. Game Play Analysis I - *Easy*

**Table: Activity**

| Column Name  | Type    |
|--------------|---------|
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |

* *(player_id, event_date)* is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
* This table shows the activity of players of some games.
* Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on some day using some device.

Write a solution to find the first login date for each player.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

Input: 

Activity table:

| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
|-----------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-05-02 | 6            |
| 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |

Output: 

| player_id | first_login |
|-----------|-------------|
| 1         | 2016-03-01  |
| 2         | 2017-06-25  |
| 3         | 2016-03-02  |

## **Solution:**

```python
import pandas as pd

def game_analysis(activity: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:

    ans = activity.groupby('player_id').agg(first_login = ('event_date', 'min')).reset_index()

    return ans
```

## Explanation:

Let's break down the provided code step by step:

```python
import pandas as pd
```
This line imports the Pandas library and assigns it the alias `pd`.

```python
def game_analysis(activity: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
```
This code defines a function named `game_analysis` that takes a Pandas DataFrame `activity` as a parameter. The type annotation `: pd.DataFrame` indicates that the `activity` parameter is expected to be a DataFrame. The function is annotated to return a Pandas DataFrame.

```python
    ans = activity.groupby('player_id').agg(first_login=('event_date', 'min')).reset_index()
```
In this line, the `groupby()` method is applied to the `activity` DataFrame. The DataFrame is grouped by the 'player_id' column. The `agg()` method is then used to aggregate the grouped data. The aggregation is done using a dictionary-like syntax, where `first_login = ('event_date', 'min')` specifies that a new column named 'first_login' should be created, and its values should be calculated using the 'min' function applied to the 'event_date' column within each group. This effectively finds the earliest login date for each player.

The `reset_index()` method is then used to reset the index of the resulting DataFrame, converting the 'player_id' group labels back into columns.

```python
    return ans
```
Finally, the modified DataFrame containing the player IDs and their corresponding earliest login dates is returned as the output of the `game_analysis` function.

To summarize, the `game_analysis` function takes a DataFrame of game activity records, groups the data by player IDs, calculates the earliest login date for each player, and returns a DataFrame with player IDs and their respective earliest login dates. The structure of this function is very similar to the previously explained version.

## About "agg()" Function:

In pandas, the `agg()` function is used to perform aggregation operations on a DataFrame or Series. Aggregation involves applying a function that reduces multiple values to a single value. The `agg()` function allows you to apply multiple aggregation functions to different columns of a DataFrame, and it's particularly useful when you want to compute multiple summary statistics in one step.

**Syntax:**
```python
DataFrame.agg(func=None, axis=0, *args, **kwargs)
```

- `func`: This parameter specifies the aggregation function(s) to apply. It can be a single function or a list/dictionary of functions to apply to specific columns. Common aggregation functions include `'sum'`, `'mean'`, `'max'`, `'min'`, `'median'`, etc.
- `axis`: Specifies whether the aggregation is applied along rows (`axis=0`, default) or columns (`axis=1`).
- `*args` and `**kwargs`: Additional arguments and keyword arguments that can be passed to the aggregation functions.

**Example:**
Consider a DataFrame with information about employees:

```python
import pandas as pd

data = {
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Cathy', 'David'],
    'Age': [25, 30, 28, 22],
    'Salary': [60000, 80000, 75000, 55000]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

You can use the `agg()` function to compute various summary statistics:

```python
agg_result = df.agg({
    'Age': ['mean', 'max'],
    'Salary': ['sum', 'min']
})

print(agg_result)
```

Output:
```
            Age Salary
mean     26.2500    NaN
max      30.0000    NaN
sum          NaN  270000
min          NaN   55000
```

In this example, the aggregation functions are applied to specific columns:
- For the 'Age' column, the mean and maximum values are computed.
- For the 'Salary' column, the sum and minimum values are computed.

The `NaN` values in the result indicate that those aggregation functions are not applicable to the corresponding columns.

You can also use the `agg()` function with built-in aggregation functions directly:

```python
agg_result = df.agg(['mean', 'max', 'sum'])

print(agg_result)
```

Output:
```
      Name    Age  Salary
mean   NaN  26.25     NaN
max   NaN  30.00     NaN
sum   NaN  105.00  270000
```

In this case, the `agg()` function applies the specified aggregation functions to all columns in the DataFrame.

The `agg()` function is a powerful tool for performing custom aggregations, especially when you need to compute multiple summary statistics simultaneously across different columns of your data.
