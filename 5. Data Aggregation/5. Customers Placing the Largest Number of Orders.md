## 586. Customer Placing the Largest Number of Orders - *Easy*

**Table: Orders**

| Column Name     | Type     |
|-----------------|----------|
| order_number    | int      |
| customer_number | int      |

* order_number* is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
* This table contains information about the order ID and the customer ID.

Write a solution to find the *customer_number* for the customer who has placed the largest number of orders.

The test cases are generated so that exactly one customer will have placed more orders than any other customer.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

Input: 

Orders table:

| order_number | customer_number |
|--------------|-----------------|
| 1            | 1               |
| 2            | 2               |
| 3            | 3               |
| 4            | 3               |

Output: 

| customer_number |
|-----------------|
| 3               |

Explanation: 
The customer with number 3 has two orders, which is greater than either customer 1 or 2 because each of them only has one order. So the result is customer_number 3.

## **Solution:**

```python
import pandas as pd

def largest_orders(orders: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:

    ans = orders['customer_number'].mode().to_frame()

    return ans
```

## Explanation:

Let's break down the provided code step by step:

```python
import pandas as pd
```
This line imports the Pandas library and assigns it the alias `pd`.

```python
def largest_orders(orders: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
```
This code defines a function named `largest_orders` that takes a Pandas DataFrame `orders` as a parameter. The type annotation `: pd.DataFrame` indicates that the `orders` parameter is expected to be a DataFrame. The function is annotated to return a Pandas DataFrame.

```python
    ans = orders['customer_number'].mode().to_frame()
```
In this line, the `.mode()` method is applied to the 'customer_number' column of the `orders` DataFrame. The `.mode()` method calculates the mode (most frequent value) of the column. The result is a Pandas Series containing the mode(s) of the 'customer_number' column. The `.to_frame()` method is then used to convert the Series into a DataFrame.

```python
    return ans
```
Finally, the DataFrame `ans` containing the mode(s) of the 'customer_number' column, representing the most frequently occurring customer number(s) in the orders, is returned as the output of the `largest_orders` function.

To summarize, the `largest_orders` function takes a DataFrame of order information, calculates the most frequently occurring customer number(s), and returns a DataFrame with the mode(s) of the customer numbers. Note that if there are multiple customer numbers with the same highest frequency, they will all be included in the resulting DataFrame.

## About "mode()" Function:

In pandas, the `mode()` function is used to calculate the mode of a DataFrame or Series. The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a set of data. The `mode()` function returns a Series containing the mode(s) of the data, which could be a single value or multiple values if there are multiple modes.

**Syntax for Series:**
```python
Series.mode(dropna=True)
```

**Syntax for DataFrame:**
```python
DataFrame.mode(axis=0, numeric_only=False, dropna=True)
```

- `dropna`: This parameter controls whether missing values (NaN) are excluded from consideration when calculating the mode. By default, it's set to `True`.
- `axis`: For DataFrames, this parameter specifies whether to calculate the mode along rows (`axis=0`) or columns (`axis=1`).
- `numeric_only`: For DataFrames, this parameter determines whether only numeric columns are considered when calculating the mode. By default, it's set to `False`.

**Example:**
Consider a DataFrame with exam scores:

```python
import pandas as pd

data = {
    'Student': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Cathy', 'David', 'Eve'],
    'Score': [85, 92, 85, 88, 92]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

You can use the `mode()` function to find the mode of the 'Score' column:

```python
mode_result = df['Score'].mode()

print(mode_result)
```

Output:
```
0    85
1    92
dtype: int64
```

In this example, the 'Score' column has two modes: 85 and 92, as these are the values that appear most frequently.

For DataFrames, you can use the `mode()` function with additional parameters:

```python
mode_result = df.mode()

print(mode_result)
```

Output:
```
  Student  Score
0   Alice     85
1     Bob     92
```

In this case, the `mode()` function calculates the mode for each column separately.

It's important to note that the `mode()` function returns a Series or DataFrame, depending on whether you apply it to a Series or DataFrame. If you apply it to a DataFrame, you'll get a DataFrame containing modes for each column.

Keep in mind that a dataset might have multiple modes, or it might not have any mode at all if all values are unique. The `mode()` function is useful for identifying the most frequently occurring values within your data.

## About "to_frame()" Function:

In pandas, the `to_frame()` function is used to convert a Series to a DataFrame. It allows you to transform a one-dimensional Series into a two-dimensional DataFrame while preserving the index and column names. This can be useful when you want to perform operations that are more suited for DataFrames on a Series.

**Syntax:**
```python
Series.to_frame(name=None)
```

- `name`: This parameter specifies the name of the column in the resulting DataFrame. If not provided, the name of the Series will be used as the column name.

**Example:**
Let's consider a simple example:

```python
import pandas as pd

data = {
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Cathy'],
    'Age': [25, 30, 28]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Convert the 'Name' column to a DataFrame
name_series = df['Name']
name_df = name_series.to_frame()

print(name_df)
```

Output:
```
    Name
0  Alice
1    Bob
2  Cathy
```

In this example, we've taken the 'Name' column from the original DataFrame `df` and converted it to a separate DataFrame using the `to_frame()` function. The resulting DataFrame `name_df` has the 'Name' column, and the index is preserved from the original Series.

You can also provide a custom column name for the resulting DataFrame using the `name` parameter:

```python
name_df_custom = name_series.to_frame(name='Full Name')

print(name_df_custom)
```

Output:
```
  Full Name
0     Alice
1       Bob
2     Cathy
```

Using the `to_frame()` function can be helpful when you need to transform a Series into a DataFrame to combine it with other DataFrames, perform join or merge operations, or use DataFrame-specific functions for analysis or visualization.

Remember that if you have a DataFrame and you want to convert it into a Series, you can do so by selecting a single column using DataFrame indexing, like `df['column_name']`.
