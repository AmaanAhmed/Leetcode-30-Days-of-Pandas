## 1667. Fix Names in a Table - *Easy*

**Table: Users**

| Column Name    | Type    |
|----------------|---------|
| user_id        | int     |
| name           | varchar |

* user_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
* This table contains the ID and the name of the user. The name consists of only lowercase and uppercase characters.

Write a solution to fix the names so that only the first character is uppercase and the rest are lowercase.

Return the result table ordered by user_id.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

Input: 

Users table:

| user_id | name  |
|---------|-------|
| 1       | aLice |
| 2       | bOB   |

Output: 

| user_id | name  |
|---------|-------|
| 1       | Alice |
| 2       | Bob   |

## **Solution:**

```python
import pandas as pd

def fix_names(users: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    users['name'] = users['name'].str.capitalize()
    result = users.sort_values(by = 'user_id', ascending = True)
    return result
```

## Explanation:

Let's break down the provided code step by step:

```python
import pandas as pd
```
This line imports the Pandas library and assigns it the alias `pd`.

```python
def fix_names(users: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
```
This code defines a function named `fix_names` that takes a Pandas DataFrame `users` as a parameter. The type annotation `: pd.DataFrame` indicates that the `users` parameter is expected to be a DataFrame. The function is annotated to return a Pandas DataFrame.

```python
    users['name'] = users['name'].str.capitalize()
```
In this line, the 'name' column in the `users` DataFrame is modified. The `str.capitalize()` method is applied to each element in the 'name' column, which capitalizes the first letter of each word in the name. This operation effectively capitalizes the names.

```python
    result = users.sort_values(by='user_id', ascending=True)
```
Here, the `result` DataFrame is created by sorting the `users` DataFrame based on the 'user_id' column in ascending order.

```python
    return result
```
Finally, the sorted and modified DataFrame `result` is returned as the output of the `fix_names` function. This DataFrame contains the names of users with each name's first letter capitalized, and the users are sorted based on their 'user_id' in ascending order.

To summarize, the `fix_names` function takes a DataFrame of users, capitalizes the first letter of each name, sorts the users by their 'user_id', and returns a DataFrame with the modified names and sorted user IDs.
