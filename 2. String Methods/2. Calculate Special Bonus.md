## 1873. Calculate Special Bonus - *Easy*

**Table: Employees**

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| employee_id | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| salary      | int     |

* employee_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
* Each row of this table indicates the employee ID, employee name, and salary.

Write a solution to calculate the bonus of each employee. The bonus of an employee is 100% of their salary if the ID of the employee is an odd number and the employee's name does not start with the character 'M'. The bonus of an employee is 0 otherwise.

Return the result table ordered by employee_id.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

Input: 

Employees table:

| employee_id | name    | salary |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| 2           | Meir    | 3000   |
| 3           | Michael | 3800   |
| 7           | Addilyn | 7400   |
| 8           | Juan    | 6100   |
| 9           | Kannon  | 7700   |

Output: 

| employee_id | bonus |
|-------------|-------|
| 2           | 0     |
| 3           | 0     |
| 7           | 7400  |
| 8           | 0     |
| 9           | 7700  |

Explanation: 
* The employees with IDs 2 and 8 get 0 bonus because they have an even employee_id.
* The employee with ID 3 gets 0 bonus because their name starts with 'M'.
* The rest of the employees get a 100% bonus.


## **Solution:**

```python
import pandas as pd

def calculate_special_bonus(employees: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    employees['bonus'] = 0

    employees.loc[
        (employees['employee_id'] % 2 != 0) & (~employees['name'].str.startswith('M')),
        'bonus'
    ] = employees['salary']

    result = employees[['employee_id', 'bonus']].sort_values(by = 'employee_id', ascending = True)

    return result
```

## Explanation:

Let's go through the provided code step by step:

```python
import pandas as pd
```
This line imports the Pandas library and assigns it the alias `pd`.

```python
def calculate_special_bonus(employees: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
```
This code defines a function named `calculate_special_bonus` that takes a Pandas DataFrame `employees` as a parameter. The type annotation `: pd.DataFrame` indicates that the `employees` parameter is expected to be a DataFrame. The function is annotated to return a Pandas DataFrame.

```python
    employees['bonus'] = 0
```
Here, a new column named 'bonus' is added to the `employees` DataFrame, and all values in this column are initially set to 0 for all employees.

```python
    employees.loc[
        (employees['employee_id'] % 2 != 0) & (~employees['name'].str.startswith('M')),
        'bonus'
    ] = employees['salary']
```
In this line, the `loc` indexer is used to select specific rows in the `employees` DataFrame based on conditions. It updates the 'bonus' column for employees who satisfy two conditions:

1. The 'employee_id' is odd (not divisible by 2).
2. The 'name' does not start with the letter 'M'.

For these employees, the 'bonus' column is set to the corresponding 'salary' value from the same row.

```python
    result = employees[['employee_id', 'bonus']].sort_values(by='employee_id', ascending=True)
```
Here, the `result` DataFrame is created by selecting only the 'employee_id' and 'bonus' columns from the modified `employees` DataFrame. The DataFrame is then sorted based on the 'employee_id' in ascending order.

```python
    return result
```
Finally, the modified and sorted DataFrame `result` is returned as the output of the `calculate_special_bonus` function. This DataFrame contains the employee IDs and their respective bonuses (if applicable) based on the given conditions.

To summarize, the `calculate_special_bonus` function takes a DataFrame of employees, calculates bonuses for specific employees based on conditions related to employee ID and name, and returns a DataFrame with employee IDs and their corresponding bonuses.
