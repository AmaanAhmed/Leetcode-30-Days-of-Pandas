## Here are a few functions that will make the code even more comprehensible for you. Feel free to skip this section if you're already familiar with these concepts.

### > About melt() Function:

In the context of the Python programming language and the pandas library, the `melt` function is used to reshape and transform dataframes. It's an essential tool for restructuring data from a wide format to a long format. The `melt` function is particularly useful when you have a dataframe where multiple columns represent different variables, and you want to "melt" or "unpivot" these columns into a single column, thereby making the data more suitable for analysis, visualization, or further processing.

Here's a breakdown of how the `melt` function works and its parameters:

**Syntax:**
```python
pandas.melt(frame, id_vars=None, value_vars=None, var_name=None, value_name='value', col_level=None)
```

**Parameters:**
- `frame`: This is the dataframe you want to melt.
- `id_vars`: A list (or single column name) of columns to be retained in the resulting melted dataframe. These columns will serve as identifiers and will not be melted.
- `value_vars`: A list (or single column name) of columns to be melted. If not provided, all columns not specified in `id_vars` will be melted.
- `var_name`: The name of the column that will store the variable names from the melted columns. Default is `'variable'`.
- `value_name`: The name of the column that will store the values from the melted columns. Default is `'value'`.
- `col_level`: If the columns are multi-indexed, this parameter specifies the level to melt.

**Example:**
Let's say you have the following dataframe:

```python
import pandas as pd

data = {
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Cathy'],
    'Math': [90, 85, 78],
    'Science': [88, 92, 80],
    'History': [75, 87, 91]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

This dataframe has columns 'Name', 'Math', 'Science', and 'History'. If you want to melt the 'Math', 'Science', and 'History' columns into a long format, you can use the `melt` function as follows:

```python
melted_df = pd.melt(df, id_vars=['Name'], value_vars=['Math', 'Science', 'History'], var_name='Subject', value_name='Score')
```

In this example:
- The `id_vars` parameter specifies that the 'Name' column should be retained as an identifier.
- The `value_vars` parameter specifies the columns to be melted ('Math', 'Science', 'History').
- The `var_name` parameter renames the column that will store the variable names as 'Subject'.
- The `value_name` parameter renames the column that will store the values as 'Score'.

The resulting `melted_df` will look like:

```
     Name  Subject  Score
0   Alice     Math     90
1     Bob     Math     85
2   Cathy     Math     78
3   Alice  Science     88
4     Bob  Science     92
5   Cathy  Science     80
6   Alice  History     75
7     Bob  History     87
8   Cathy  History     91
```

As you can see, the melted dataframe is in a long format where each row represents a combination of a student's name, subject, and score. This format is often more suitable for various types of analysis and visualization.

The `melt` function is a powerful tool for data manipulation and transformation in pandas, especially when dealing with wide datasets that need to be reshaped for specific analytical needs.

### > About agg() Function: 

In pandas, the `agg()` function is used to perform aggregation operations on a DataFrame or Series. Aggregation involves applying a function that reduces multiple values to a single value. The `agg()` function allows you to apply multiple aggregation functions to different columns of a DataFrame, and it's particularly useful when you want to compute multiple summary statistics in one step.

**Syntax:**
```python
DataFrame.agg(func=None, axis=0, *args, **kwargs)
```

- `func`: This parameter specifies the aggregation function(s) to apply. It can be a single function or a list/dictionary of functions to apply to specific columns. Common aggregation functions include `'sum'`, `'mean'`, `'max'`, `'min'`, `'median'`, etc.
- `axis`: Specifies whether the aggregation is applied along rows (`axis=0`, default) or columns (`axis=1`).
- `*args` and `**kwargs`: Additional arguments and keyword arguments that can be passed to the aggregation functions.

**Example:**
Consider a DataFrame with information about employees:

```python
import pandas as pd

data = {
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Cathy', 'David'],
    'Age': [25, 30, 28, 22],
    'Salary': [60000, 80000, 75000, 55000]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

You can use the `agg()` function to compute various summary statistics:

```python
agg_result = df.agg({
    'Age': ['mean', 'max'],
    'Salary': ['sum', 'min']
})

print(agg_result)
```

Output:
```
            Age Salary
mean     26.2500    NaN
max      30.0000    NaN
sum          NaN  270000
min          NaN   55000
```

In this example, the aggregation functions are applied to specific columns:
- For the 'Age' column, the mean and maximum values are computed.
- For the 'Salary' column, the sum and minimum values are computed.

The `NaN` values in the result indicate that those aggregation functions are not applicable to the corresponding columns.

You can also use the `agg()` function with built-in aggregation functions directly:

```python
agg_result = df.agg(['mean', 'max', 'sum'])

print(agg_result)
```

Output:
```
      Name    Age  Salary
mean   NaN  26.25     NaN
max   NaN  30.00     NaN
sum   NaN  105.00  270000
```

In this case, the `agg()` function applies the specified aggregation functions to all columns in the DataFrame.

The `agg()` function is a powerful tool for performing custom aggregations, especially when you need to compute multiple summary statistics simultaneously across different columns of your data.

### > About mode() Function: 

In pandas, the `mode()` function is used to calculate the mode of a DataFrame or Series. The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a set of data. The `mode()` function returns a Series containing the mode(s) of the data, which could be a single value or multiple values if there are multiple modes.

**Syntax for Series:**
```python
Series.mode(dropna=True)
```

**Syntax for DataFrame:**
```python
DataFrame.mode(axis=0, numeric_only=False, dropna=True)
```

- `dropna`: This parameter controls whether missing values (NaN) are excluded from consideration when calculating the mode. By default, it's set to `True`.
- `axis`: For DataFrames, this parameter specifies whether to calculate the mode along rows (`axis=0`) or columns (`axis=1`).
- `numeric_only`: For DataFrames, this parameter determines whether only numeric columns are considered when calculating the mode. By default, it's set to `False`.

**Example:**
Consider a DataFrame with exam scores:

```python
import pandas as pd

data = {
    'Student': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Cathy', 'David', 'Eve'],
    'Score': [85, 92, 85, 88, 92]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

You can use the `mode()` function to find the mode of the 'Score' column:

```python
mode_result = df['Score'].mode()

print(mode_result)
```

Output:
```
0    85
1    92
dtype: int64
```

In this example, the 'Score' column has two modes: 85 and 92, as these are the values that appear most frequently.

For DataFrames, you can use the `mode()` function with additional parameters:

```python
mode_result = df.mode()

print(mode_result)
```

Output:
```
  Student  Score
0   Alice     85
1     Bob     92
```

In this case, the `mode()` function calculates the mode for each column separately.

It's important to note that the `mode()` function returns a Series or DataFrame, depending on whether you apply it to a Series or DataFrame. If you apply it to a DataFrame, you'll get a DataFrame containing modes for each column.

Keep in mind that a dataset might have multiple modes, or it might not have any mode at all if all values are unique. The `mode()` function is useful for identifying the most frequently occurring values within your data.

### > About to_frame() Function: 

In pandas, the `to_frame()` function is used to convert a Series to a DataFrame. It allows you to transform a one-dimensional Series into a two-dimensional DataFrame while preserving the index and column names. This can be useful when you want to perform operations that are more suited for DataFrames on a Series.

**Syntax:**
```python
Series.to_frame(name=None)
```

- `name`: This parameter specifies the name of the column in the resulting DataFrame. If not provided, the name of the Series will be used as the column name.

**Example:**
Let's consider a simple example:

```python
import pandas as pd

data = {
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Cathy'],
    'Age': [25, 30, 28]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Convert the 'Name' column to a DataFrame
name_series = df['Name']
name_df = name_series.to_frame()

print(name_df)
```

Output:
```
    Name
0  Alice
1    Bob
2  Cathy
```

In this example, we've taken the 'Name' column from the original DataFrame `df` and converted it to a separate DataFrame using the `to_frame()` function. The resulting DataFrame `name_df` has the 'Name' column, and the index is preserved from the original Series.

You can also provide a custom column name for the resulting DataFrame using the `name` parameter:

```python
name_df_custom = name_series.to_frame(name='Full Name')

print(name_df_custom)
```

Output:
```
  Full Name
0     Alice
1       Bob
2     Cathy
```

Using the `to_frame()` function can be helpful when you need to transform a Series into a DataFrame to combine it with other DataFrames, perform join or merge operations, or use DataFrame-specific functions for analysis or visualization.

Remember that if you have a DataFrame and you want to convert it into a Series, you can do so by selecting a single column using DataFrame indexing, like `df['column_name']`.

### > About merge() Function: 

The `merge()` function in pandas is used to combine two or more DataFrames based on common columns or indices. It's a powerful tool for joining and merging data from multiple sources into a single DataFrame, enabling you to perform various types of database-like operations. The `merge()` function supports various types of joins, such as inner, outer, left, and right joins, to combine data in different ways.

**Syntax:**
```python
pandas.merge(left, right, how='inner', on=None, left_on=None, right_on=None, left_index=False, right_index=False, suffixes=('_x', '_y'), sort=False)
```

- `left` and `right`: The DataFrames you want to merge.
- `how`: Specifies the type of join to be performed ('inner', 'outer', 'left', 'right'). Default is 'inner'.
- `on`: Column(s) or index to join on. If not specified, common column names will be used.
- `left_on` and `right_on`: Column(s) from the left and right DataFrames to use as keys for the join, respectively.
- `left_index` and `right_index`: If `True`, use the index of the left or right DataFrame as the join key.
- `suffixes`: Suffixes to add to overlapping column names from the left and right DataFrames.
- `sort`: If `True`, sort the result DataFrame by the join keys.

**Example:**
Consider two DataFrames with employee information:

```python
import pandas as pd

data1 = {
    'EmployeeID': [1, 2, 3],
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Cathy']
}

data2 = {
    'EmployeeID': [2, 3, 4],
    'Department': ['HR', 'Finance', 'IT']
}

df1 = pd.DataFrame(data1)
df2 = pd.DataFrame(data2)
```

You can use the `merge()` function to perform an inner join on the 'EmployeeID' column:

```python
merged_inner = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='EmployeeID', how='inner')

print(merged_inner)
```

Output:
```
   EmployeeID   Name Department
0           2    Bob        HR
1           3  Cathy    Finance
```

In this example, an inner join is performed on the 'EmployeeID' column, and only the rows with matching IDs in both DataFrames are included in the result.

You can also perform other types of joins. For instance, an outer join includes all rows from both DataFrames:

```python
merged_outer = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='EmployeeID', how='outer')

print(merged_outer)
```

Output:
```
   EmployeeID   Name Department
0           1  Alice        NaN
1           2    Bob         HR
2           3  Cathy    Finance
3           4    NaN        IT
```

In this case, the result includes all EmployeeIDs from both DataFrames, filling in missing values with `NaN` where necessary.

The `merge()` function is a versatile tool for combining data in various ways based on common columns or indices. It's essential when you need to integrate and analyze data from different sources.
