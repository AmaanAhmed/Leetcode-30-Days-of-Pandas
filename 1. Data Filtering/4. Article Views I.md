## 1148. Article Views I - *Easy*

**Table: Views**

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| article_id    | int     |
| author_id     | int     |
| viewer_id     | int     |
| view_date     | date    |

* There is no primary key (column with unique values) for this table, the table may have duplicate rows.
* Each row of this table indicates that some viewer viewed an article (written by some author) on some date. 
* Note that equal author_id and viewer_id indicate the same person.
 
Write a solution to find all the authors that viewed at least one of their own articles.

Return the result table sorted by id in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

Input:

Views table:

| article_id | author_id | viewer_id | view_date  |
|------------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| 1          | 3         | 5         | 2019-08-01 |
| 1          | 3         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
| 2          | 7         | 7         | 2019-08-01 |
| 2          | 7         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
| 4          | 7         | 1         | 2019-07-22 |
| 3          | 4         | 4         | 2019-07-21 |
| 3          | 4         | 4         | 2019-07-21 |

Output: 

| id   |
|------|
| 4    |
| 7    |

## **Solution:**

```python
import pandas as pd

def article_views(views: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:

        filtered_df = views[views['author_id'] == views['viewer_id']]

        filtered_df.drop_duplicates(subset=['author_id'], inplace=True)

        filtered_df.sort_values(by='author_id', ascending=True, inplace=True)

        return filtered_df[['author_id']].rename(columns={'author_id': 'id'})
```

## Explanation:

Let's go through the provided code step by step:

```python
import pandas as pd
```
This line imports the Pandas library and assigns it the alias `pd`.

```python
def article_views(views: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
```
This code defines a function named `article_views` that takes a Pandas DataFrame `views` as a parameter. The type annotation `: pd.DataFrame` indicates that the `views` parameter is expected to be a DataFrame. The function is annotated to return a Pandas DataFrame.

```python
    filtered_df = views[views['author_id'] == views['viewer_id']]
```
Here, a new DataFrame `filtered_df` is created. It is a subset of the input `views` DataFrame, containing only rows where the 'author_id' matches the 'viewer_id'. This line filters the DataFrame to include only rows where an author is also a viewer, essentially representing cases where authors have viewed their own articles.

```python
    filtered_df.drop_duplicates(subset=['author_id'], inplace=True)
```
In this line, the `drop_duplicates` method is applied to the `filtered_df` DataFrame. It removes duplicate rows based on the 'author_id' column, so that each unique author is represented only once in the DataFrame. The `inplace=True` parameter means the operation is performed directly on `filtered_df`.

```python
    filtered_df.sort_values(by='author_id', ascending=True, inplace=True)
```
Here, the `sort_values` method is used to sort the `filtered_df` DataFrame based on the 'author_id' column in ascending order. This step ensures that the DataFrame is sorted by author IDs.

```python
    return filtered_df[['author_id']].rename(columns={'author_id': 'id'})
```
Finally, the modified DataFrame `filtered_df` is returned as the output of the `article_views` function. Before returning, the code selects only the 'author_id' column and renames it to 'id', effectively changing the column label.

To summarize, the `article_views` function takes a DataFrame of article views, filters it to include only authors who have viewed their own articles, removes duplicate authors, sorts the authors by their IDs, and then returns a DataFrame with a single column named 'id', containing the sorted unique author IDs.
