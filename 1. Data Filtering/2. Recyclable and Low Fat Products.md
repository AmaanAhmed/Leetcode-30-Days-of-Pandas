## **Recyclable and Low Fat Products - *Easy***

**Table: Products**

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| product_id  | int     |
| low_fats    | enum    |
| recyclable  | enum    |

- product_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
- low_fats is an ENUM (category) of type ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is low fat and 'N' means it is not.
- recyclable is an ENUM (category) of types ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is recyclable and 'N' means it is not.

Write a solution to find the ids of products that are both low fat and recyclable.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

Input:

Products table:

| product_id  | low_fats | recyclable |
|-------------|----------|------------|
| 0           | Y        | N          |
| 1           | Y        | Y          |
| 2           | N        | Y          |
| 3           | Y        | Y          |
| 4           | N        | N          |

Output: 

| product_id  |
|-------------|
| 1           |
| 3           |

Explanation: Only products 1 and 3 are both low fat and recyclable.

## **Solution:**

```python
import pandas as pd

def find_products(products: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:

    result_df = products[(products['low_fats'] == 'Y') & (products['recyclable'] == 'Y')]
    
    result_df = result_df[['product_id']]
    
return result_df
```

## Explanation:

```python
import pandas as pd
```
This line imports the Pandas library and renames it as `pd`. Pandas is a popular Python library for data manipulation and analysis, especially when working with tabular data.

```python
def find_products(products: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
```
This defines a function named `find_products` that takes one parameter `products`, which is expected to be a Pandas DataFrame. The function is also annotated to indicate that it returns a Pandas DataFrame.

```python
    result_df = products[(products['low_fats'] == 'Y') & (products['recyclable'] == 'Y')]
```
Here, a new DataFrame `result_df` is created. It's a subset of the input `products` DataFrame, filtered to include only the rows where both the 'low_fats' column and the 'recyclable' column have values of 'Y'. The expression `(products['low_fats'] == 'Y')` and `(products['recyclable'] == 'Y')` create boolean masks that indicate which rows satisfy the conditions.

The `&` operator is a logical "AND" operation, so this line effectively filters the DataFrame to include only rows that have both 'low_fats' set to 'Y' and 'recyclable' set to 'Y'.

```python
    result_df = result_df[['product_id']]
```
In this line, the `result_df` DataFrame is further modified. Only the 'product_id' column is retained in the DataFrame, and other columns are dropped. This operation effectively creates a new DataFrame with only the 'product_id' column.

```python
    return result_df
```
Finally, the filtered and modified DataFrame `result_df` is returned from the `find_products` function as the output of the function call.

In summary, this code defines a function `find_products` that takes a DataFrame containing product information. It filters the DataFrame to include only rows where products have both 'low_fats' and 'recyclable' attributes set to 'Y', then it further filters to keep only the 'product_id' column. The resulting DataFrame containing selected 'product_id' values is returned as the output of the function.
