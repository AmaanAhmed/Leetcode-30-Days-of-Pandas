## **Big Countries - *Easy***

**Table: World**

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| name        | varchar |
| continent   | varchar |
| area        | int     |
| population  | int     |
| gdp         | bigint  |

 - name is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
 - Each row of this table gives information about the name of a country,
   the continent to which it belongs, its area, the population, and its
   GDP value.

**A country is big if:**

 - it has an area of at least three million (i.e., 3000000 km2), or it
 - It has a population of at least twenty-five million (i.e., 25000000).

Write a solution to find the name, population, and area of the big countries. Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example. 

**Example 1:**

Input: 
World table:

| name        | continent | area    | population | gdp          |
|-------------|-----------|---------|------------|--------------|
| Afghanistan | Asia      | 652230  | 25500100   | 20343000000  |
| Albania     | Europe    | 28748   | 2831741    | 12960000000  |
| Algeria     | Africa    | 2381741 | 37100000   | 188681000000 |
| Andorra     | Europe    | 468     | 78115      | 3712000000   |
| Angola      | Africa    | 1246700 | 20609294   | 100990000000 |


Output: 

| name        | population | area    |
|-------------|------------|---------|
| Afghanistan | 25500100   | 652230  |
| Algeria     | 37100000   | 2381741 |


## Solution:

```python
import pandas as pd
    
def  big_countries(world: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame
   
   big_countries_df = world[(world['area'] >= 3000000) | (world['population'] >= 25000000)]
	result_df = big_countries_df[['name', 'population', 'area']]
	
return result_df
```

## Explanation:

Let's break down the provided code step by step:

1. `import pandas as pd`: This line imports the Pandas library and gives it the alias `pd`.

2. Defining the function:

   ```python
   def big_countries(world: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
   ```
   Here, a function named `big_countries` is defined. It takes one argument, `world`, which is expected to be a Pandas DataFrame. The function is also annotated with type hints, indicating that the input and output should be Pandas DataFrames.

3. Selecting big countries:

   ```python
   big_countries_df = world[(world['area'] >= 3000000) | (world['population'] >= 25000000)]
   ```

   This line creates a new DataFrame called `big_countries_df` by filtering the `world` DataFrame. It selects rows where either the 'area' column has a value greater than or equal to 3,000,000 (indicating an area of at least 3 million square units) OR the 'population' column has a value greater than or equal to 25,000,000 (indicating a population of at least 25 million). Essentially, this filters for countries that are either large in terms of area or have a substantial population.

4. Selecting specific columns:

   ```python
   result_df = big_countries_df[['name', 'population', 'area']]
   ```

   This line creates another DataFrame called `result_df` by selecting specific columns from the `big_countries_df`. It includes only the 'name', 'population', and 'area' columns, discarding the other columns from `big_countries_df`.

5. Returning the result:
   
   ```python
   return result_df
   ```

   This line returns the `result_df` DataFrame as the output of the `big_countries` function.

In summary, the `big_countries` function takes a DataFrame containing world country data, filters out countries that are either large in terms of area or have a substantial population, and then creates a new DataFrame containing only the name, population, and area information of these selected countries.
