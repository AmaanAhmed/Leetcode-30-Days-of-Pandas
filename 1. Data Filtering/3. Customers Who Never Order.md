## 183. Customers Who Never Order - *Easy*

**Table: Customers**

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |

- id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
- Each row of this table indicates the ID and name of a customer.
 
**Table: Orders**

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| id          | int  |
| customerId  | int  |

* id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
* customerId is a foreign key (reference columns) of the ID from the Customers table.
* Each row of this table indicates the ID of an order and the ID of the customer who ordered it.
 
Write a solution to find all customers who never order anything.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

Input: 

Customers table:

| id | name  |
|----|-------|
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |

Orders table:

| id | customerId |
|----|------------|
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |

Output: 

| Customers |
|-----------|
| Henry     |
| Max       |

## **Solution:**

```python
import pandas as pd

def find_customers(customers: pd.DataFrame, orders: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    
        df = customers[~customers['id'].isin(orders['customerId'])]

        df = df[['name']].rename(columns={'name': 'Customers'})

        return df
```

## Explanation:

Let's break down the provided code line by line:

```python
import pandas as pd
```
This line imports the Pandas library and assigns the alias `pd` to it, which is a common convention in Python when working with Pandas.

```python
def find_customers(customers: pd.DataFrame, orders: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
```
This code defines a function named `find_customers` which takes two DataFrame parameters: `customers` and `orders`. The type annotations (`: pd.DataFrame`) indicate that both `customers` and `orders` are expected to be Pandas DataFrames. The function is also annotated to return a Pandas DataFrame.

```python
    df = customers[~customers['id'].isin(orders['customerId'])]
```
Here, a new DataFrame `df` is created. It filters the `customers` DataFrame to exclude rows where the 'id' column (presumably a unique customer identifier) is present in the 'customerId' column of the `orders` DataFrame. The `~` operator negates the condition, so it selects rows where the 'id' is **not** present in the 'customerId' column. Essentially, this line filters out customers who have placed orders.

```python
    df = df[['name']].rename(columns={'name': 'Customers'})
```
In this line, the `df` DataFrame is further modified. Only the 'name' column is retained, and the column is renamed to 'Customers' using the `rename` method. This operation renames the column label 'name' to 'Customers'.

```python
    return df
```
Finally, the modified DataFrame `df`, containing the names of customers who have not placed orders, is returned as the output of the `find_customers` function.

To summarize, the `find_customers` function takes two DataFrames (`customers` and `orders`), filters out customers who have placed orders, retains only the 'name' column, and returns a DataFrame containing the names of customers who haven't placed orders.
