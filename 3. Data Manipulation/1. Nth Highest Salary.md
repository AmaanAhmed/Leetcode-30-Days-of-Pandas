## 177. Nth Highest Salary - *Medium*

**Table: Employee**

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |

* id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
* Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.

Write a solution to find the nth highest salary from the Employee table. If there is no nth highest salary, return null.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

Input: 

Employee table:

| id | salary |
|----|--------|
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |

n = 2

Output: 

| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
|------------------------|
| 200                    |

**Example 2:**

Input: 

Employee table:

| id | salary |
|----|--------|
| 1  | 100    |

n = 2

Output: 

| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
|------------------------|
| null                   |

## **Solution:**

```python
import pandas as pd

def nth_highest_salary(employee: pd.DataFrame, N: int) -> pd.DataFrame:

    new_df = employee['salary'].drop_duplicates()

    sorted_df = new_df.sort_values(ascending = False)

    if N > len(sorted_df):
        return pd.DataFrame({'Nth Highest Salary': [None]})

    Nth = sorted_df.iloc[N-1]

    return pd.DataFrame({'Nth Highest Salary': [Nth]})
```

## Explanation:

Let's go through the provided code line by line:

```python
import pandas as pd
```
This line imports the Pandas library and assigns it the alias `pd`.

```python
def nth_highest_salary(employee: pd.DataFrame, N: int) -> pd.DataFrame:
```
This code defines a function named `nth_highest_salary` that takes two parameters: a Pandas DataFrame `employee` containing employee information and an integer `N` indicating the desired position of the highest salary. The type annotations `: pd.DataFrame` and `: int` indicate the expected types of the parameters. The function is annotated to return a Pandas DataFrame.

```python
    new_df = employee['salary'].drop_duplicates()
```
Here, a new DataFrame `new_df` is created by selecting the 'salary' column from the input `employee` DataFrame and then removing duplicate salary values using the `drop_duplicates()` method. This results in a DataFrame containing unique salary values.

```python
    sorted_df = new_df.sort_values(ascending=False)
```
The `sorted_df` DataFrame is created by sorting the `new_df` DataFrame in descending order using the `sort_values()` method.

```python
    if N > len(sorted_df):
        return pd.DataFrame({'Nth Highest Salary': [None]})
```
This conditional statement checks if the value of `N` is greater than the length of the `sorted_df` DataFrame. If this condition is met, it means that there aren't enough unique salaries to find the Nth highest salary, so a DataFrame with a single row containing `None` is returned to indicate that.

```python
    Nth = sorted_df.iloc[N-1]
```
If the condition above is not met, this line retrieves the Nth highest salary from the `sorted_df` DataFrame using the `iloc` indexer. Note that `N-1` is used because indexing in Pandas is zero-based.

```python
    return pd.DataFrame({'Nth Highest Salary': [Nth]})
```
Finally, a DataFrame is created with a single row containing the Nth highest salary value, and this DataFrame is returned as the output of the function.

To summarize, the `nth_highest_salary` function takes a DataFrame of employee information and an integer N, finds the Nth highest salary among unique salary values, and returns a DataFrame with the Nth highest salary value. If N is greater than the number of unique salary values, a DataFrame with `None` is returned.
