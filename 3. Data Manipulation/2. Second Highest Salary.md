## 176. Second Highest Salary - *Medium*

**Table: Employee**

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |

* id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
* Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.

Write a solution to find the second highest salary from the Employee table. If there is no second highest salary, return null (return None in Pandas).

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

Input: 

Employee table:

| id | salary |
|----|--------|
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |

Output: 

| SecondHighestSalary |
|---------------------|
| 200                 |

**Example 2:**

Input: 

Employee table:

| id | salary |
|----|--------|
| 1  | 100    |

Output: 

| SecondHighestSalary |
|---------------------|
| null                |

## **Solution:**

```python
import pandas as pd

def second_highest_salary(employee: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:

    N = 2

    new_df = employee['salary'].drop_duplicates()

    sorted_df = new_df.sort_values(ascending = False)

    if N > len(sorted_df):
        return pd.DataFrame({'SecondHighestSalary': [None]})

    Nth = sorted_df.iloc[N-1]

    return pd.DataFrame({'SecondHighestSalary': [Nth]})
```

## Explanation:

Let's break down the provided code line by line:

```python
import pandas as pd
```
This line imports the Pandas library and assigns it the alias `pd`.

```python
def second_highest_salary(employee: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
```
This code defines a function named `second_highest_salary` that takes a Pandas DataFrame `employee` as a parameter. The type annotation `: pd.DataFrame` indicates that the `employee` parameter is expected to be a DataFrame. The function is annotated to return a Pandas DataFrame.

```python
    N = 2
```
Here, the integer `N` is assigned a value of 2, indicating that the function is looking for the second highest salary.

```python
    new_df = employee['salary'].drop_duplicates()
```
A new DataFrame `new_df` is created by selecting the 'salary' column from the input `employee` DataFrame and removing duplicate salary values using the `drop_duplicates()` method. This results in a DataFrame containing unique salary values.

```python
    sorted_df = new_df.sort_values(ascending=False)
```
The `sorted_df` DataFrame is created by sorting the `new_df` DataFrame in descending order using the `sort_values()` method.

```python
    if N > len(sorted_df):
        return pd.DataFrame({'SecondHighestSalary': [None]})
```
This conditional statement checks if the value of `N` (which is 2) is greater than the length of the `sorted_df` DataFrame. If this condition is met, it means that there aren't enough unique salary values to find the second highest salary, so a DataFrame with a single row containing `None` is returned to indicate that.

```python
    Nth = sorted_df.iloc[N-1]
```
If the condition above is not met, this line retrieves the second highest salary from the `sorted_df` DataFrame using the `iloc` indexer. Note that `N-1` is used because indexing in Pandas is zero-based, and in this case, `N` is 2.

```python
    return pd.DataFrame({'SecondHighestSalary': [Nth]})
```
Finally, a DataFrame is created with a single row containing the second highest salary value, and this DataFrame is returned as the output of the function.

To summarize, the `second_highest_salary` function takes a DataFrame of employee information, finds the second highest salary among unique salary values, and returns a DataFrame with the second highest salary value. If there aren't enough unique salaries, a DataFrame with `None` is returned.
