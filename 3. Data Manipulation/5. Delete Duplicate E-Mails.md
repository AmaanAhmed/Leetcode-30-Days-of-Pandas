## 196. Delete Duplicate Emails - *Easy*

**Table: Person**

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| email       | varchar |

* id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
* Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.

Write a solution to delete all duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id.

For SQL users, please note that you are supposed to write a DELETE statement and not a SELECT one.

For Pandas users, please note that you are supposed to modify Person in place.

After running your script, the answer shown is the Person table. The driver will first compile and run your piece of code and then show the Person table. The final order of the Person table does not matter.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

Input: 

Person table:

| id | email            |
|----|------------------|
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |

Output: 

| id | email            |
|----|------------------|
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |

Explanation: `john@example.com` is repeated two times. We keep the row with the smallest `Id = 1`.

## **Solution:**

```python
import pandas as pd

def delete_duplicate_emails(person: pd.DataFrame):
    person.sort_values(by='id', inplace=True)
    person.drop_duplicates(subset=['email'], inplace=True)
```

## Explanation:

Let's go through the provided code step by step:

```python
import pandas as pd
```
This line imports the Pandas library and assigns it the alias `pd`.

```python
def delete_duplicate_emails(person: pd.DataFrame):
```
This code defines a function named `delete_duplicate_emails` that takes a Pandas DataFrame `person` as a parameter. The function does not have a return type annotation, suggesting it will modify the `person` DataFrame in place.

```python
    person.sort_values(by='id', inplace=True)
```
Here, the `sort_values()` method is used to sort the `person` DataFrame based on the 'id' column. The `inplace=True` parameter means that the sorting is applied directly to the DataFrame.

```python
    person.drop_duplicates(subset=['email'], inplace=True)
```
The `drop_duplicates()` method is applied to the `person` DataFrame to remove rows with duplicate values in the 'email' column. The `inplace=True` parameter ensures that the operation is performed directly on the DataFrame, modifying it in place.

To summarize, the `delete_duplicate_emails` function takes a DataFrame of person information, sorts the DataFrame based on the 'id' column, and then removes rows with duplicate email addresses, effectively deleting duplicate email records from the DataFrame. The changes are made directly in the provided DataFrame.
