## 184. Department Highest Salary - *Medium*

**Table: Employee**

| Column Name  | Type    |
|--------------|---------|
| id           | int     |
| name         | varchar |
| salary       | int     |
| departmentId | int     |

* id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
* departmentId is a foreign key (reference columns) of the ID from the Department table.
* Each row of this table indicates the ID, name, and salary of an employee.
* It also contains the ID of their department.

**Table: Department**

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |

* id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table. It is guaranteed that the department name is not NULL.
* Each row of this table indicates the ID of a department and its name.

Write a solution to find employees who have the highest salary in each of the departments.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

Input: 

Employee table:

| id | name  | salary | departmentId |
|----|-------|--------|--------------|
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 1            |
| 2  | Jim   | 90000  | 1            |
| 3  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 4  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 5  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |

Department table:

| id | name  |
|----|-------|
| 1  | IT    |
| 2  | Sales |

Output: 

| Department | Employee | Salary |
|------------|----------|--------|
| IT         | Jim      | 90000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |

Explanation: Max and Jim both have the highest salary in the IT department, and Henry has the highest salary in the Sales department.

## **Solution:**

```python
import pandas as pd

def department_highest_salary(employee: pd.DataFrame, department: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:

        merged_df = employee.merge(department, left_on='departmentId', right_on='id', suffixes=('_employee', '_department'))

        highest_salary_df = merged_df.groupby('departmentId').apply(lambda x: x[x['salary'] == x['salary'].max()])

        highest_salary_df = highest_salary_df.reset_index(drop=True)

        result_df = highest_salary_df[['name_department', 'name_employee', 'salary']]

        result_df.columns = ['Department','Employee', 'Salary']

        return result_df
```

## Explanation:

Let's go through the provided code step by step:

```python
import pandas as pd
```
This line imports the Pandas library and assigns it the alias `pd`.

```python
def department_highest_salary(employee: pd.DataFrame, department: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
```
This code defines a function named `department_highest_salary` that takes two Pandas DataFrames `employee` and `department`, as well as their respective salaries. The type annotations `: pd.DataFrame` indicate the expected types of the parameters. The function is annotated to return a Pandas DataFrame.

```python
    merged_df = employee.merge(department, left_on='departmentId', right_on='id', suffixes=('_employee', '_department'))
```
Here, a new DataFrame `merged_df` is created by performing an inner join operation between the `employee` and `department` DataFrames. The join is done based on the 'departmentId' column in `employee` and the 'id' column in `department`. The `suffixes` parameter is used to add suffixes to the columns in case of overlapping column names after the join.

```python
    highest_salary_df = merged_df.groupby('departmentId').apply(lambda x: x[x['salary'] == x['salary'].max()])
```
This line groups the `merged_df` DataFrame by 'departmentId' and then applies a lambda function to each group. The lambda function selects rows within each group where the 'salary' is equal to the maximum salary within that group. Essentially, this line filters out rows within each department group to retain only the rows with the highest salary for that department.

```python
    highest_salary_df = highest_salary_df.reset_index(drop=True)
```
The index of the `highest_salary_df` DataFrame is reset to remove the group-level indices introduced by the `groupby()` operation. The `drop=True` parameter prevents the old index from being added as a column in the DataFrame.

```python
    result_df = highest_salary_df[['name_department', 'name_employee', 'salary']]
```
A new DataFrame `result_df` is created by selecting only the 'name_department', 'name_employee', and 'salary' columns from the `highest_salary_df` DataFrame.

```python
    result_df.columns = ['Department','Employee', 'Salary']
```
The column names of the `result_df` DataFrame are renamed to 'Department', 'Employee', and 'Salary'.

```python
    return result_df
```
Finally, the modified DataFrame `result_df` is returned as the output of the `department_highest_salary` function. This DataFrame contains information about the department, the employee with the highest salary in each department, and their corresponding salary.

To summarize, the `department_highest_salary` function takes employee and department DataFrames, performs a join, filters the highest salaries for each department, and returns a DataFrame with information about the highest salaried employee in each department along with their salaries.
