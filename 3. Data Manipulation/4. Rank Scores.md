## 178. Rank Scores - *Medium*

**Table: Scores**

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| score       | decimal |

* id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
* Each row of this table contains the score of a game. The score is a floating-point value with two decimal places.

Write a solution to find the rank of the scores. The ranking should be calculated according to the following rules:

1. The scores should be ranked from the highest to the lowest.
2. If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking.
3. After a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no holes between ranks.

Return the result table ordered by score in descending order.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

Input: 

Scores table:

| id | score |
|----|-------|
| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.85  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |

Output: 

| score | rank |
|-------|------|
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 3.85  | 2    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.50  | 4    |

## **Solution:**

```python
import pandas as pd

def order_scores(scores: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    scores['rank'] = scores['score'].rank(method='dense', ascending=False)
    
    ans = scores.drop('id',axis=1).sort_values(by='score', ascending=False)
    
    return ans
```

## Explanation:

Let's go through the provided code step by step:

```python
import pandas as pd
```
This line imports the Pandas library and assigns it the alias `pd`.

```python
def order_scores(scores: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
```
This code defines a function named `order_scores` that takes a Pandas DataFrame `scores` as a parameter. The type annotation `: pd.DataFrame` indicates that the `scores` parameter is expected to be a DataFrame. The function is annotated to return a Pandas DataFrame.

```python
    scores['rank'] = scores['score'].rank(method='dense', ascending=False)
```
In this line, a new column named 'rank' is added to the `scores` DataFrame. The `rank()` method is applied to the 'score' column to calculate the ranks of the scores. The parameter `method='dense'` specifies the ranking method, and `ascending=False` indicates that higher scores will have lower ranks (e.g., the highest score will have a rank of 1).

```python
    ans = scores.drop('id', axis=1).sort_values(by='score', ascending=False)
```
Here, a new DataFrame `ans` is created. First, the 'id' column is dropped from the `scores` DataFrame using the `drop()` method with `axis=1` to indicate column removal. Then, the DataFrame is sorted in descending order based on the 'score' column using the `sort_values()` method.

```python
    return ans
```
Finally, the sorted DataFrame `ans` is returned as the output of the `order_scores` function. This DataFrame contains the 'score' and 'rank' columns for each row, sorted by score in descending order.

To summarize, the `order_scores` function takes a DataFrame of scores, calculates the ranks of scores using the 'dense' ranking method, removes the 'id' column, sorts the DataFrame based on scores, and returns the resulting DataFrame with scores and ranks.
