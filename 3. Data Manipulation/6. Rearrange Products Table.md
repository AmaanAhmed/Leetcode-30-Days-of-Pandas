## 1795. Rearrange Products Table - *Easy*

**Table: Products**

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| product_id  | int     |
| store1      | int     |
| store2      | int     |
| store3      | int     |

* product_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
* Each row in this table indicates the product's price in 3 different stores: store1, store2, and store3.
* If the product is not available in a store, the price will be null in that store's column.

Write a solution to rearrange the Products table so that each row has (product_id, store, price). If a product is not available in a store, do not include a row with that product_id and store combination in the result table.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

Input: 

Products table:

| product_id | store1 | store2 | store3 |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0          | 95     | 100    | 105    |
| 1          | 70     | null   | 80     |

Output: 

| product_id | store  | price |
|------------|--------|-------|
| 0          | store1 | 95    |
| 0          | store2 | 100   |
| 0          | store3 | 105   |
| 1          | store1 | 70    |
| 1          | store3 | 80    |

Explanation: 
* Product 0 is available in all three stores with prices 95, 100, and 105 respectively.
* Product 1 is available in store1 with price 70 and store3 with price 80. The product is not available in store2.

## **Solution:**

```python
import pandas as pd

def rearrange_products_table(products: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:

    ans = products.melt(id_vars = ['product_id'], value_vars = ['store1', 'store2', 'store3'], var_name = 'store', value_name = 'price')

    ans = ans.dropna()

    return ans
```

## Explanation:

Let's go through the provided code step by step:

```python
import pandas as pd
```
This line imports the Pandas library and assigns it the alias `pd`.

```python
def rearrange_products_table(products: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
```
This code defines a function named `rearrange_products_table` that takes a Pandas DataFrame `products` as a parameter. The type annotation `: pd.DataFrame` indicates that the `products` parameter is expected to be a DataFrame. The function is annotated to return a Pandas DataFrame.

```python
    ans = products.melt(id_vars=['product_id'], value_vars=['store1', 'store2', 'store3'], var_name='store', value_name='price')
```
In this line, the `melt()` function is applied to the `products` DataFrame. This function reshapes the DataFrame by "melting" it, which means transforming it from a wide format to a long format. The following transformations occur:

- The column 'product_id' is kept as an identifier column using the `id_vars` parameter.
- The columns 'store1', 'store2', and 'store3' are combined into a single column named 'store' using the `value_vars` parameter.
- The corresponding values from these columns are combined into a single column named 'price' using the `value_name` parameter.
- The variable column name for the store columns is named 'store' using the `var_name` parameter.

The result is a DataFrame where each row corresponds to a product and a store with the corresponding price.

```python
    ans = ans.dropna()
```
In this line, the `dropna()` method is applied to the `ans` DataFrame to remove any rows that have missing values (NaN). This is done to ensure that only complete rows are kept in the DataFrame.

```python
    return ans
```
Finally, the modified DataFrame `ans` is returned as the output of the `rearrange_products_table` function. This DataFrame represents the reshaped and rearranged product information, with each row containing the product ID, store, and price.

To summarize, the `rearrange_products_table` function takes a wide-format DataFrame of product information, melts it into a long-format DataFrame by combining store columns into a 'store' column and corresponding price values into a 'price' column, drops any rows with missing values, and returns the reshaped DataFrame.
