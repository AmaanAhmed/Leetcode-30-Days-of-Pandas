## 1795. Rearrange Products Table - *Easy*

**Table: Products**

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| product_id  | int     |
| store1      | int     |
| store2      | int     |
| store3      | int     |

* product_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
* Each row in this table indicates the product's price in 3 different stores: store1, store2, and store3.
* If the product is not available in a store, the price will be null in that store's column.

Write a solution to rearrange the Products table so that each row has (product_id, store, price). If a product is not available in a store, do not include a row with that product_id and store combination in the result table.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

Input: 

Products table:

| product_id | store1 | store2 | store3 |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0          | 95     | 100    | 105    |
| 1          | 70     | null   | 80     |

Output: 

| product_id | store  | price |
|------------|--------|-------|
| 0          | store1 | 95    |
| 0          | store2 | 100   |
| 0          | store3 | 105   |
| 1          | store1 | 70    |
| 1          | store3 | 80    |

Explanation: 
* Product 0 is available in all three stores with prices 95, 100, and 105 respectively.
* Product 1 is available in store1 with price 70 and store3 with price 80. The product is not available in store2.

## **Solution:**

```python
import pandas as pd

def rearrange_products_table(products: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:

    ans = products.melt(id_vars = ['product_id'], value_vars = ['store1', 'store2', 'store3'], var_name = 'store', value_name = 'price')

    ans = ans.dropna()

    return ans
```

## Explanation:

Let's go through the provided code step by step:

```python
import pandas as pd
```
This line imports the Pandas library and assigns it the alias `pd`.

```python
def rearrange_products_table(products: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
```
This code defines a function named `rearrange_products_table` that takes a Pandas DataFrame `products` as a parameter. The type annotation `: pd.DataFrame` indicates that the `products` parameter is expected to be a DataFrame. The function is annotated to return a Pandas DataFrame.

```python
    ans = products.melt(id_vars=['product_id'], value_vars=['store1', 'store2', 'store3'], var_name='store', value_name='price')
```
In this line, the `melt()` function is applied to the `products` DataFrame. This function reshapes the DataFrame by "melting" it, which means transforming it from a wide format to a long format. The following transformations occur:

- The column 'product_id' is kept as an identifier column using the `id_vars` parameter.
- The columns 'store1', 'store2', and 'store3' are combined into a single column named 'store' using the `value_vars` parameter.
- The corresponding values from these columns are combined into a single column named 'price' using the `value_name` parameter.
- The variable column name for the store columns is named 'store' using the `var_name` parameter.

The result is a DataFrame where each row corresponds to a product and a store with the corresponding price.

```python
    ans = ans.dropna()
```
In this line, the `dropna()` method is applied to the `ans` DataFrame to remove any rows that have missing values (NaN). This is done to ensure that only complete rows are kept in the DataFrame.

```python
    return ans
```
Finally, the modified DataFrame `ans` is returned as the output of the `rearrange_products_table` function. This DataFrame represents the reshaped and rearranged product information, with each row containing the product ID, store, and price.

To summarize, the `rearrange_products_table` function takes a wide-format DataFrame of product information, melts it into a long-format DataFrame by combining store columns into a 'store' column and corresponding price values into a 'price' column, drops any rows with missing values, and returns the reshaped DataFrame.

## About "melt()" Function:

In the context of the Python programming language and the pandas library, the `melt` function is used to reshape and transform data frames. It's an essential tool for restructuring data from a wide format to a long format. The `melt` function is particularly useful when you have a data frame where multiple columns represent different variables, and you want to "melt" or "unpivot" these columns into a single column, thereby making the data more suitable for analysis, visualization, or further processing.

Here's a breakdown of how the `melt` function works and its parameters:

**Syntax:**
```python
pandas.melt(frame, id_vars=None, value_vars=None, var_name=None, value_name='value', col_level=None)
```

**Parameters:**
- `frame`: This is the dataframe you want to melt.
- `id_vars`: A list (or single column name) of columns to be retained in the resulting melted dataframe. These columns will serve as identifiers and will not be melted.
- `value_vars`: A list (or single column name) of columns to be melted. If not provided, all columns not specified in `id_vars` will be melted.
- `var_name`: The name of the column that will store the variable names from the melted columns. Default is `'variable'`.
- `value_name`: The name of the column that will store the values from the melted columns. Default is `'value'`.
- `col_level`: If the columns are multi-indexed, this parameter specifies the level to melt.

**Example:**
Let's say you have the following data frame:

```python
import pandas as pd

data = {
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Cathy'],
    'Math': [90, 85, 78],
    'Science': [88, 92, 80],
    'History': [75, 87, 91]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

This data frame has columns 'Name', 'Math', 'Science', and 'History'. If you want to melt the 'Math', 'Science', and 'History' columns into a long format, you can use the `melt` function as follows:

```python
melted_df = pd.melt(df, id_vars=['Name'], value_vars=['Math', 'Science', 'History'], var_name='Subject', value_name='Score')
```

In this example:
- The `id_vars` parameter specifies that the 'Name' column should be retained as an identifier.
- The `value_vars` parameter specifies the columns to be melted ('Math', 'Science', 'History').
- The `var_name` parameter renames the column that will store the variable names as 'Subject'.
- The `value_name` parameter renames the column that will store the values as 'Score'.

The resulting `melted_df` will look like this:

```
     Name  Subject  Score
0   Alice     Math     90
1     Bob     Math     85
2   Cathy     Math     78
3   Alice  Science     88
4     Bob  Science     92
5   Cathy  Science     80
6   Alice  History     75
7     Bob  History     87
8   Cathy  History     91
```

As you can see, the melted data frame is in a long format where each row represents a combination of a student's name, subject, and score. This format is often more suitable for various types of analysis and visualization.

The `melt` function is a powerful tool for data manipulation and transformation in pandas, especially when dealing with wide datasets that need to be reshaped for specific analytical needs.
